\chapter{A PREDICTION OF THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF \ce{Au144PET60} NANOARRAYS}\label{chap:arrays}
\section{Introduction}
Thiolated gold nanocluster have been studied in great detail both experimentally and theoretically.\cite{Hakkinen2012, Sardar2009, Jin2010, Tsukuda2012}
The electronic,\cite{Lopez-Acevedo2011,Walter2008} optical,\cite{Cui2014} and catalytic properties;\cite{Chen2013, Lopez-Acevedo2010} with respect to size range of the cluster and ligand identity pose promising features to make them building blocks for nanotechnology applications.\cite{Dong2011,Podsiadlo2010,Shevchenko2006,Talapin2010}
Additionally, nanocrystal arrays, close-packed structures of nanoparticles from a colloidal solution, have been proposed as alternatives for expensive single-cystal semiconductors materials in transistors,\cite{Talapin2005} memory devices,\cite{Sun1999} solar cells,\cite{Tang2011,Gur2005,Ehrler2012} and thermoelectrics.\cite{Ong:2013rt,Kovalenko2010,Wang2008,Ko2011} 

One of the first theoretical studies of nanocrystal arrays was performed by Luedtke and Landman which examined small clusters with alkanethiol ligands on a graphite surface and in superlattices.\cite{Luedtke1996} 
A more recent experimental study by Liu \textit{et al.} presented the effect of surface chemistry on the thermal conductivity of a nanocrystal array.\cite{Liu2015}
The study by Liu \textit{et al.} varied nanocrystal core size, the binding group of the ligand and the ligand length. The primary finding was that with a decrease to the ligand length or an increase to the core size the material thermal conductivity increased. 
The volume fraction of the insulating material, the ligand, is reduced in both of those cases.

Similar results have been seen in theorectical studies of nanocrystal arrays by Ong \textit{et al.}\cite{Ong:2014yq} and Zanjani \textit{et al.}\cite{Zanjani2014} with respect to core diameter.
In particular Ong \textit{et al.} found that in nanocrystal arrays vibrational states are able to elastically couple across the interfaces, with a thermal conductivity that is dependent on the density of the ligand layer.\cite{Ong:2014yq} The coupling was further studied through varying the core atomic mass and finding the relationship with the interfacial thermal conductivity.

The study by Zanjani \textit{et al.} on gold nanocrystals with hexylthiol capping ligands varied core size and ligand density.\cite{Zanjani2014}
The phonon dispersion of the superlattice structures were obtained and the thermal conductivity of the nanocrystal arrays displayed the same trends as Liu \textit{et al.} observed, an increase in thermal conductivity of the array with an decreased volume percentage of the ligand layer.\cite{Liu2015} 

All the nanoparticles previously studied contain $N> 500$ atoms. Recent work by Pohjolainen \textit{et al.} provides structures and force field parameters based upon crystal structures for thiolated gold nanoclusters found in a matching crystalography study of the clusters in arrays.\cite{Pohjolainen2016} 
The provided structures contain individual particles as well as nanoarrays, with the largest of the parameterized structures contains 144 \ce{Au} atoms. All of the characterized nanoclusters have a staple motif ligand that was shown to be thermally stable in this model. Many of the parameters were taken from work from Banerjee \textit{et al.} that looked at \ce{Au25} and \ce{Au38} nanoclusters.

The staple motif in these nanoclusters present an interesting idea for thermal transport. 
The staple motif has three gold atoms (for the largest particle), two of the gold atoms in the staple are in direct contact with the core of the particle, while the remaining atom is within the ligand layer, bonded to sulfur atoms. Based upon previous work on the thermal properties due to under-coordination of gold atoms the surface,\cite{Neidhart2017} the gold atoms within the staple motif could present interesting properties. 
For this reason we have looked at single particles and arrays of \ce{Au144PET60} cluster in two solvents and fit to the Hasselman and Johnson equation for thermal conductivity of composite materials.\cite{Hasselman}
\subsection{Theory}
Hasselman and Johnson is first proposed a predictive formula for the effective thermal conductivity of a composite material using known material properties.\cite{Hasselman}
The following equation is the original formulation of the Hasselman and Johnson equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:composite}
    \lambda_e = \lambda_s \bigg( \frac{\lambda_p (1+2\alpha)+2\lambda_s +2v_p[\lambda_p(1-\alpha)-\lambda_s]}{\lambda_p (1+2\alpha)+2\lambda_s -v_p[\lambda_p(1-\alpha)-\lambda_s]} \bigg)
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_e$ is the effective thermal conductivity of the composite material, $\lambda_p$ and $\lambda_s$ are the particle and solvent thermal conductivities, $v_p$ is the volume fraction of the nanoparticles, and $\alpha$ is the interfacial term.
The interfacial term is a dimensionless term that is composed of the thermal boundary resistance over the radius of the particle.
The thermal boundary resistance in this work is taken to be
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{R_{TBR}}{r_p} = \frac{\lambda_s}{Gr_p}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the interfacial thermal conductivity from the particle to the solvent, and $r_p$ is the radius of the particle.
Modifications to the Hasselman and Johnson equation have been made by Minnich \textit{et al.} to include an interface density for the spherical particles and a more formal volume fraction of the nanoparticles.\cite{Minnich2007}

Each portion of Eq. \ref{eq:composite} can be calculated in order to predict a composite material thermal conductivity. 
The volume fraction of the particles can be found through geometric means using the information about the particles in the array.
The thermal conductivity of the solvent, $\lambda_s$ , can be found through simulations of bulk solvent. 
Similarly, $\lambda_p$ can be calculated from bulk simulations of the core material of the particle. 
The most difficult piece is the $\alpha$ term, where the interfacial thermal conductivity of the particles is the primary value of importance.
The interfacial thermal conductance of the nanoclusters investigated in this work were found using the same method as Stocker \textit{et al.} for nanospheres.\cite{Stocker2016}

Typically modelling work of heat conduction of nanoarrays consider only one method for thermal transport: conduction.
This work is a purely classical approximation of nanoarrays and does not consider electron effects (such as polarization of the gold surface and radiation). 
While convection could be seen through classical simulations the time scales involved would take extensive simulations and result in an expensive study. 
Additionally, the solvent between the particles in the arrays could display altered diffusion coefficients due to confinement and change in temperature.
Any coupling in these systems between the gold particles could only be seen through a classical means and the electronic contributions are not considered.
\section{Computational Details}
Nanoarrays of \ce{Au_144PET_60} solvated with either toluene or dichloromethane were simulated using reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD).
Individual components of the system: single particles in each solvent, pure solvent, and liquid gold; simulations were also prepared and simulated using RNEMD.
The following sections describe the potentials used for the interactions in the system as well as how the systems were created and prepared.

    \label{fig:single-part}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Force Fields}
In the particle systems and the liquid gold simulations, the gold--gold interactions are calculated using the quantum Sutton-Chen (QSC) model.\cite{Qi:1999ph}
Within the \ce{Au_144PET_60} particle there are three distinct gold atom types defined: \ce{Au_{body}}, \ce{Au_{surface}}, and \ce{Au_{ligand}}. 
The gold interior to the particle, the icosahedral core, is defined as an \ce{Au_{body}} atom.
The other two gold atom types are within the ligand staple motif and are bonded to sulfur atoms.
\ce{Au_{surface}} is the gold in the staple motif that is in direct contact with the surface of the particle. 
\ce{Au_{surface}} is treated with QSC for the interactions with \ce{Au_{body}} but with a Lennard-Jones potential for \ce{Au_{ligand}}, which is further from the surface of the particle and bonded between two sulfur atoms.
\ce{Au_{ligand}} is treated as a Lennard-Jones atom type with parameters from Pohjolainen \textit{et. al.}.\cite{Pohjolainen2016}
All parameters for the staple motif use parameters from Pohjolainen \textit{et. al.}\cite{Pohjolainen2016} and Banerjee \textit{et al.}\cite{Banerjee2012} in addition to parameters from TraPPE-UA\cite{TraPPE-UA.alkanes,TraPPE-UA.alkylbenzenes} which can be found in Table \ref{tab:staple-parameters}.

The solvent models, dichloromethane and toluene, and the organic ligands use parameters from united atom models.
Dichloromethane is modeled with Lennard-Jones atoms type and charges are taken from Meyer \textit{et. al.}\cite{Meyer1978} and the intramolecular parameters use harmonic force constants from OPLS-AA.\cite{Jorgensen1998}
Toluene is modeled as a rigid body in a trans conformation using parameters from TraPPE-UA.\cite{TraPPE-UA.alkylbenzenes} %(From TraPPE-UA JPCB 104, 8008)
Within the ligand staple motif, the carbon atoms were treated with TraPPE-UA,\cite{TraPPE-UA.alkanes,TraPPE-UA.alkylbenzenes,TraPPE-UA.thiols} while the sulfur used parameters from TraPPE-UA\cite{TraPPE-UA.thiols} and bonds, bends, and torsions for the staple from Pohjolainen.\cite{Pohjolainen2016}

Non-bonded interactions between the staple motif and icosahedral core of the particles are modeled through parameters derived from adsorption studies of thiolates on Au surfaces.
The S—-Au non-bonded parameters are adopted from work from Luedtke and Landman,\cite{landman:1998} where thiolates are absorbed on Au(111) surfaces .

Other interactions between Au and non-metal atoms in the staple ligand are adapted from an adsorption study by Vlugt \textit{et. al.},\cite{vlugt:cpc2007154} of alkyl thiols on gold surfaces. The parameters are from a pair-wise Lennard-Jones potential for the interaction between Au and $\mathrm{CH}_x$ and S based upon the Hautman and Klein potential for Au(111) surfaces.\cite{Klein01}
The non-bonded interactions between gold atoms and toluene solvent use parameters from the same work.
Au and dichloromethane interactions use the aforemented work from Vlugt for the central carbon and the Au-Cl interactions was found through Johnson mixing rules.\cite{Johnson89}

\subsection{Simulation Protocol}
The gold particle simulations are started from crystal structures provided in work from Pohjolainen \textit{et. al}.\cite{Pohjolainen2016}
The crystal structures were thermalized to 250K then solvated using packmol\cite{packmol} with either dichloromethane or toluene molecules that were also equilibrated to 250K.
The amount of solvent was chosen such that packing sphere was at least 3x the radius of the particle and that the solvent would maintain bulk density near the interface (see Table \ref{tab:solvated-part-comp} for exact packing).
At least 7 separate configurations of the nanoparticles were found before the random packing of each solvent.

Solvated particles were then brought to 250K using the Langevin Hull ensemble.\cite{Vardeman2011} 
Once equilibrated with thermal coupling to the bath for at least 1 ns, the system was simulated without the coupling for 1 ns. 
The particle systems were simulated using RNEMD for 1 ns where a thermal flux was applied to find the resulting temperature gradient. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/dcm-part.pdf}
    \caption{ A single \ce{Au144PET60} cluster in a solvent cloud of dichloromethane.}
    \label{fig:lambda-bulk}
\end{figure}

Pure solvent simulations were prepared through a simple `fcc' builder using the bulk solvent density. 
Random seeds were used to create five separate simulations for three different simulation box lengths.
These simulations were equilibrated to 250K using the canonical (NVT) ensemble for at least 1 ns followed by further relaxation in the (NPT) ensemble for 1 ns.
Finally, the pure solvent systems underwent at least 1 ns in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble before undergoing a RNEMD simulation for 10 ns.

The pure gold systems followed the same protocol as the dichloromethane and toluene systems, except the temperature for the pure gold system is 1500K, above the melting point of bulk gold.
After equilibration, the relevant thermal flux was applied for 3 ns.
To achieve a similar temperature gradient across the three box sizes (for all bulk simulations), the applied thermal flux was adjusted, see Table \ref{tab:bulk-comp}.
Depending on the size of the system, more time might be needed to allow a steady state temperature gradient to develop, all systems were ran to the longest time scale needed to achieve a steady state.

The average temperature of the system remained at 250K for the pure solvent, single nanoparticle, and nanoarray systems; and 1500K for the liquid gold simulations.
In the pure solvent, single nanoparticle, and nanoarray systems this temperature preserved the solvent cloud close to the bulk density near the interface of the particle.
Additionally, thermal coupling to the external temperature bath for the single nanoparticle systems was removed to avoid thermal interference with the imposed flux.

%For the pure solvent and gold simulations, 15 independent simulations were carried out with five systems with random seeds at three different box lengths.
%The single nanoparticle simulations use at least 7 separate configurations of the nanoparticles before the random packing of each solvent, to ensure statistical independence.

The nanoarrays use eight different particle geometries, packed within the 2 particle x 2 particle x 2 particle array, with a center of mass to center of mass distance of 30 \AA.
These arrays were thermalized to 250K, then solvated with either toluene or dichloromethane with random seeds to create five different configurations of the solvent using packmol.\cite{packmol}
Solvated arrays were equilibrated at 250K in the canonical ensemble then further equilibrated for at least 1 ns in the microcanonical ensemble.
These simple structures were replicated in the z-direction to create multiples of the unit cell, up to a 2x2x8 particle array, then equilibrated at 250K in the canonical ensemble and at least 1 ns in the microcanonical ensemble.

After equilibration the arrays were simulated with a thermal flux for at least 10 ns or until a steady state was reached.
Similar to the bulk boxes, to achieve a similar temperature gradient across the box, the applied thermal flux was adjusted for the different array sizes.

All simulations were carried out using the open source molecular dynamics package OpenMD.\cite{openmd}
Thermal conductivity and interfacial thermal conductivity were calculated using methods described in works by Kuang \textit{et. al.} for periodic systems,\cite{Kuang:2011ef} and Stocker \textit{et. al.}  for non-periodic systems.\cite{Stocker:2014qq}

\subsection{Calculating thermal conductivity}
Thermal conductivity is related to the applied flux through the following:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{J_z}{\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}} = \frac{J_z}{m}
\end{equation}
where $J_z$ is the applied thermal flux and $\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}$ is the slope from the temperature gradient that develops in the simulation.
The thermal gradient created from the applied flux in a box of solvent is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lambda-grad}. The red and blue bins are the hot and cold bins, respectively.
The slope of the temperature gradient, $m$, is $\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}$.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/bulk-gradient.pdf}
    \caption{This figure is an example of the thermal gradient that develops in a bulk solvent system with a moderate flux. The red region is the ``hot'' bin and the two blue regions are the ``cold'' bins. The slope, $m$, that measures the temperature gradient is related to the thermal conductivity of the material, $\lambda$.}
    \label{fig:lambda-grad}
\end{figure}

In addition to finding the thermal conductivity of a material at different box lengths, the infinite box length thermal conductivity of the material is extrapolated using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\lambda_{\infty}}= \frac{1}{\lambda_L} +\frac{C}{L}
    \label{eq:lambda_inf}
\end{equation}
where $C$ is a constant and $L$ is the length of the simulation box in the z-direction.\cite{Hannah2015} 

\section{Results and Discussion}
A prediction of the Hasselman and Johnson equation for a simple array of \ce{Au144PET60} particles was found through simulating each components of the equation.
The bulk gold conductivity is compared to a previous study looking at gold particles in an array. 
Ultimately, as found in previous work by Zanjani \textit{et al.}\cite{Zanjani2014} and Ong \textit{et al.}\cite{Ong:2014yq}, the volume fraction of the array is the essential piece to the predictive equation.
While the interface is of a smaller importance to the prediction of the thermal conductivity of the material, the comparison of how the two solvents affect heat transport out of the nanoclusters confirms previous finding about solvent penetration being of paramount importance to thermal transport.
In the following sections each of the individual components of the Hasselman and Johnson equation, as well as a prediction will be presented.
Additionally, thermal conductivity of the arrays will be discussed in comparison to the predicted results.

\subsection{Bulk Solvent and Bulk Gold Conductivity}
For the bulk dichloromethane and toluene solvent simulations, both where projected to a infinite thermal conductivity using Eq \ref{eq:lambda_inf}. 
As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:inverselambda}, the box length dependent thermal conductivity is necessary for dichloromethane solvent.
While the projection to an infinite box size using Eq. \ref{eq:lambda_inf} is not supported by the data for toluene and liquid gold.

The thermal conductivity of the dichloromethane from the projection to an infinite box and the thermal conductivity average of the toluene boxes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lambda-bulk}.
The thermal conductivity of dichloromethane is extrapolated to be 0.1084 $\pm$ 0.0021 W/mK and the conductivity of toluene is averaged to be 0.1082 $\pm$ 0.0054 W/mK.
If composition of the array is primarily solvent, the Hasselman and Johnson equation will give nearly the same conductivity for the array due to the solvents having matching $
\lambda$'s.
It is important to note that the applied flux was small enough to not change the density of the solvent across the simulation box due to the `hot' and `cold' bins.

\end{figure}

The bulk gold simulations are essential to finding $\lambda_p$ from Eq. \ref{eq:composite}. Previous work from Ong \textit{et al.}\cite{Ong:2014yq} used bulk gold thermal conductivity of 1.8 $\pm$ 0.3 W/mK from simulations of a bulk `fcc' gold at 300 K for simulations of a gold nanocrystal array.
Their value will be compared to the conductivity of a bulk gold simulation at 1500 K, pass the melting point of the gold in QSC.
QSC has a size dependent melting temperature and previous particles of slightly larger radius have been shown to display liquid like structures.\cite{Stocker2016}
Experimentally, particles with $N<219$ have been seen with an approximate melting temperature of 500 K.\cite{Ercolessi1991}
Additionally, it was proposed through extrapolating melting temperatures vs. diameter, that the \ce{Au144PET60} cluster (with a diameter of $\approx$ 18 \AA) would melt at approximately 600 K.\cite{Buffat1976}
Hence the high temperature simulations of 100 \AA, 200 \AA, and 300 \AA\ box length in z were computed and displayed a $\lambda_p$ = 0.3787 $\pm$ 0.02 W/mK.
The lower conductivity makes intuitive sense; when the gold melts the ballistic phonons traveling through the gold lattice are disrupted and the transmission of the phonons decreases.

\subsection{Interfacial Thermal Conductivity}
Experimentally difficult and computational complicated, the interfacial thermal conductance, $G$, for the particles was found in the two solvents.
In an attempt to force the interfacial density of toluene in these single particle to more closely match the experimental bulk density, the solvent outside of the interfacial is about twice the density of bulk toluene.
This was not an issue with the dichloromethane systems. 
Across the staple motif the thermal conductivity in the toluene was 11.37 $\pm$ 0.66 MW/m$^2$K, while in dichloromethane $G$ = 74.73 $\pm$ 4.28 MW/m$^2$K.

%POSSIBLY SOMETHING ABOUT THE INTERPENETRATION OF SOLVENT
\subsection{Prediction of Array Thermal Conductivity}
Along with the components of the equation for bulk thermal conductivity, there is a geometric feature, $v_p$, the partial volume of the \ce{Au144PET60} particles in the array.
The partial volume is approximated through the effective radius of the particles, which is taken from the average of the radius for only the gold atoms and the radius of the total particle.
This approximations gives a partial volume of 22.5\%.
A total particle volume which includes all the ligand layer, allows for solvent to penetrate into the particle and would overestimate the volume fraction of the particles for a $v_p = 47.7\%$.

Using the parameters found, $\lambda_s$, $\lambda_p$, $G$, and $v_p$, the Hasselman and Johnson equation can be used to predict the thermal conductivity of the array.
Using the bulk gold thermal conductivity reported by Ong \textit{et al.} for gold at 300 K and the value calculated here for 1500 K, the array thermal conductivity can be found in Table \ref{tab:predition}.
As seen in previous work,\cite{Ong:2014yq, Liu2015, Zanjani2014} the volume fraction of the particles is the main determining factor of the thermal conductivity. 
With the small $v_p$, $\lambda_s$ dominates $\lambda_e$, thus there is a similar conductivity for the array across solvent (since $\lambda_s$ is nearly the same for the bulk thermal conductivity) and $\lambda_p$.

\end{table}

\subsection{Simulations of Array}
Preliminary results of the smallest constructed array display behavior that indicate that Eq. \ref{eq:composite} might be missing a more complex component of the system.
The smallest system (2x2x2) in dichloromethane was simulated to find $\lambda = 0.0307 \pm 0.009$ W/mK. 
This is far below the predicted value of 0.1184 W/mK, but the dichloromethane bulk solvent displayed box length dependent thermal conductivity.
Therefore, it is possible that with larger arrays in dichloromethane, a box length dependent thermal conductivity will be seen. 
Additionally, it is possible that the dichloromethane in the arrays behaves differently than the bulk fluid and might have thermal properties more similar to a confined liquid.

\section{Conclusions}
While there is still more that needs to be explained in the nanoarrays of the \ce{Au144PET60} particles, interesting results have been found in the predictive Hasselman and Johnson model. 
To use the model, each component of the nanoarray was simulated to find the relevant thermal quantity. 
As found in previous works, the main component of the Eq. \ref{eq:composite} is $v_p$. 
The geometric arrangement of the array is the most important aspect contributing to the thermal conductance of the material.

In finding the component pieces of Eq. \ref{eq:composite}, interest results were found for the pure liquid simulations and the interfacial thermal conductivity of the particle.
The two solvents not having agreeing box length dependent behavior brings interesting questions about the density dependent thermal conductivity of liquids.
Similarly, the immense difference for $G$ between the two solvent interfaces with the particle, brings about questions of what most important ligand--solvent design.
