The thermal decays of tiopronin-stabilized 3−5-nm diameter AuPd alloy nanoparticles, thioalkylated ethylene glycol-stabilized 3−5-nm diameter AuPd nanoparticles, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-stabilized 22-nm diameter Au-core/AuPd-shell nanoparticles give thermal conductances G ≈ 100−300 MW m-2 K-1 for the particle/water interfaces, approximately an order of magnitude larger than the conductance of the interfaces between alkanethiol-terminated AuPd nanoparticles and toluene. The similar values of G for particles ranging in size from 3 to 24 nm with widely varying surface chemistry indicate that the thermal coupling between AuPd nanoparticles and water is strong regardless of the self-assembled stabilizing group. },

	Abstract = { Thermal transport between CTAB passivated gold nanorods and solvent is studied by an optical pump−probe technique. Increasing the free CTAB concentration from 1 mM to 10 mM causes a ∼3× increase in the CTAB layer's effective thermal interface conductance and a corresponding shift in the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance. The transition occurs near the CTAB critical micelle concentration, revealing the importance of the role of free ligand on thermal transport. },

                  interactions where calculation of the microscopic

	Abstract = { We use the universal force field (UFF) developed by Rapp{\'e} et al. (Rapp{\'e}, A. K.; Casewit, C. J.; Colwell, K. S.; Goddard, W. A.; Skiff, W. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 10024) and the specific classical potentials developed from ab initio calculations for Au−benzenedithiol (BDT) molecule interaction to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a BDT monolayer on an extended Au(111) surface. The simulation system consists of 100 BDT molecules and three rigid Au layers in a simulation box that is rhombic in the plane of the Au surface. A multiple time scale algorithm, the double-reversible reference system propagator algorithm (double RESPA) based on the Nos{\'e}−Hoover dynamics scheme, and the Ewald summation with a boundary correction term for the treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions in a 2-D slab have been incorporated into the simulation technique. We investigate the local bonding properties of Au−BDT contacts and molecular orientation distributions of BDT molecules. These results show that whereas different basis sets from ab initio calculations may generate different local bonding geometric parameters (the bond length, etc.) the packing structures of BDT molecules maintain approximately the same well-ordered herringbone structure with small peak differences in the probability distributions of global geometric parameters. The methodology developed here opens an avenue for classical simulations of a metal−molecule−metal complex in molecular electronics devices. },

	Abstract = { The different possible proton-ordered structures of ice Ih for an orthorombic unit cell with 8 water molecules were derived. The number of unique structures was found to be 16. The crystallographic coordinates of these are reported. The energetics of the different polymorphs were investigated by quantum-mechanical density-functional theory calculations and for comparison by molecular-mechanics analytical potential models. The polymorphs were found to be close in energy, i.e., within approximately 0.25 kcal/mol H2O, on the basis of the quantum-chemical DFT methods. At 277 K, the different energy levels are about evenly populated, but at a lower temperature, a transition to an ordered form is expected. This form was found to agree with the ice phase XI. The difference in lattice energies among the polymorphs was rationalized in terms of structural characteristics. The most important parameters to determine the lattice energies were found to be the distributions of water dimer H-bonded pair conformations, in an intricate manner. },

The effective thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol is shown to be increased by up to 40\% for a nanofluid consisting of ethylene glycol containing approximately 0.3 vol \% Cu nanoparticles of mean diameter < 10 nm. The results are anomalous based on previous theoretical calculations that had predicted a strong effect of particle shape on effective nanofluid thermal conductivity, but no effect of either particle size or particle thermal conductivity.

	Abstract = {Tissue surface temperature distribution on the treatment site can serve as an indicator for the effectiveness of a photothermal therapy. In this study, both infrared thermography and theoretical simulation were used to determine the surface temperature distribution during laser irradiation of both gel phantom and animal tumors. Selective photothermal interaction was attempted by using intratumoral indocyanine green enhancement and irradiation via a near-infrared laser. An immunoadjuvant was also used to enhance immunological responses during tumor treatment. Monte Carlo method for tissue absorption of light and finite difference method for heat diffusion in tissue were used to simulate the temperature distribution during the selective laser photothermal interaction. An infrared camera was used to capture the thermal images during the laser treatment and the surface temperature was determined. Our findings show that the theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement and that the surface temperature of irradiated tissue can be controlled with appropriate dye and adjuvant enhancement. These results can be used to control the laser tumor treatment parameters and to optimize the treatment outcome. More importantly, when used with immunotherapy as a precursor of immunological responses, the selective photothermal treatment can be guided by the tissue temperature profiles both in the tumor and on the surface.},

Different models are considered to determine how they affect the heat transfer dynamics. They include temperature equilibrated (TE) and temperature gradient (TG) thermostat models for the Au(s) surface{,} and soft and stiff S/Au(s) models for bonding of the S-atoms to the Au(s) surface. A detailed analysis of the non-equilibrium heat transfer at the heterogeneous interface is presented. There is a short time temperature gradient within the top layers of the Au(s) surface. The S-atoms heat rapidly{,} much faster than do the C-atoms in the alkylthiolate chains. A high thermal conductivity in the H-SAM{,} perpendicular to the interface{,} results in nearly identical temperatures for the CH2 and CH3 groups versus time. Thermal-induced disorder is analyzed for the Au(s) substrate{,} the S/Au(s) interface and the H-SAM. Before heat transfer occurs from the hot Au(s) substrate to the H-SAM{,} there is disorder at the S/Au(s) interface and within the alkylthiolate chains arising from heat-induced disorder near the surface of hot Au(s). The short-time rapid heating of the S-atoms enhances this disorder. The increasing disorder of H-SAM chains with time results from both disorder at the Au/S interface and heat transfer to the H-SAM chains.},

	Abstract = { In a previous article (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.2010, 12, 4435), nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of heat transfer from a hot Au{111} substrate to an alkylthiolate self-assembled monolayer (H-SAM) were presented. The simulations were performed for an H-SAM chain length of eight carbon atoms, and a qualitative agreement with the experiments of Wang et al. (Science2007, 317, 787) was found. Here, simulation results are presented for heat transfer to H-SAM surfaces with carbon chain lengths of 10--20 carbon atoms. Relaxation times for heat transfer are extracted, compared with experiment, and a qualitative agreement is obtained. The same relaxation time is found from either the temperature of the H-SAM or the orientational disorder of the H-SAM versus time. For a simulation model with the Au substrate thermally equilibrated, the relaxation times determined from the simulations are approximately a factor of 4 larger than the experimental values. },

	Abstract = {Plasmon-resonant gold nanorods, which have large absorption cross sections at near-infrared frequencies, are excellent candidates as multifunctional agents for image-guided therapies based on localized hyperthermia. The controlled modification of the surface chemistry of the nanorods is of critical importance, as issues of cell-specific targeting and nonspecific uptake must be addressed prior to clinical evaluation. Nanorods coated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (a cationic surfactant used in nanorod synthesis) are internalized within hours into KB cells by a nonspecific uptake pathway, whereas the careful removal of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide from nanorods functionalized with folate results in their accumulation on the cell surface over the same time interval. In either case, the nanorods render the tumor cells highly susceptible to photothermal damage when irradiated at the nanorods' longitudinal plasmon resonance, generating extensive blebbing of the cell membrane at laser fluences as low as 30 J/cm(2).},

In this review, we discuss the SPR-enhanced optical properties of noble metal nanoparticles, with an emphasis on the recent advances in the utility of these plasmonic properties in molecular-specific imaging and sensing, photo-diagnostics, and selective photothermal therapy. The strongly enhanced SPR scattering from Au nanoparticles makes them useful as bright optical tags for molecular-specific biological imaging and detection using simple dark-field optical microscopy. On the other hand, the SPR absorption of the nanoparticles has allowed their use in the selective laser photothermal therapy of cancer. We also discuss the sensitivity of the nanoparticle SPR frequency to the local medium dielectric constant, which has been successfully exploited for the optical sensing of chemical and biological analytes. Plasmon coupling between metal nanoparticle pairs is also discussed, which forms the basis for nanoparticle assembly-based biodiagnostics and the plasmon ruler for dynamic measurement of nanoscale distances in biological systems.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the nonpolarizable SPC/E (Berendsen et al., J. Phys. Chem. 1987, 91, 6269) and the polarizable COS/G2 (Yu and van Gunsteren, J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 121, 9549) force fields have been employed to calculate the thermal conductivity and other associated properties of methane hydrate over a temperature range from 30 to 260 K. The calculated results are compared to experimental data over this same range. The values of the thermal conductivity calculated with the COS/G2 model are closer to the experimental values than are those calculated with the nonpolarizable SPC/E model. The calculations match the temperature trend in the experimental data at temperatures below 50 K; however, they exhibit a slight decrease in thermal conductivity at higher temperatures in comparison to an opposite trend in the experimental data. The calculated thermal conductivity values are found to be relatively insensitive to the occupancy of the cages except at low (T d 50 K) temperatures, which indicates that the differences between the two lattice structures may have a more dominant role than generally thought in explaining the low thermal conductivity of methane hydrate compared to ice Ih. The introduction of defects into the water lattice is found to cause a reduction in the thermal conductivity but to have a negligible impact on its temperature dependence.},

	Abstract = {Recent measurements on nanofluids have demonstrated that the thermal conductivity increases with decreasing grain size. However, Such increases cannot be explained by existing theories. We explore four possible explanations for this anomalous increase: Brownian motion of the particles, molecular-level layering of the liquid at the liquid/particle interface, the nature of heat transport in the nanoparticles. and the effects of nanoparticle clustering. We show that the key factors in understanding thermal properties of nanofluids are the ballistic, rather than diffusive, nature of heat transport in the nanoparticles, combined with direct or fluid-mediated clustering effects that provide paths for rapid heat transport.

	Abstract = { Equilibrium structures and thermodynamic properties of dodecanethiol self-assembled monolayers on small (Au140) and larger (Au1289) gold nanocrystallites were investigated with the use of molecular dynamics simulations. Compact passivating monolayers are formed on the (111) and (100) facets of the nanocrystallites, with adsorption site geometries differing from those found on extended flat Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces, as well as with higher packing densities. At lower temperatures the passivating molecules organize into preferentially oriented molecular bundles with the molecules in the bundles aligned approximately parallel to each other. Thermal disordering starts at T ≳200 K, initiating at the boundaries of the bundles and involving generation of intramolecular conformational (gauche) defects which occur first at bonds near the chains' outer terminus and propagate inward toward the underlying gold nanocrystalline surface as the temperature is increased. The disordering process culminates in melting of the molecular bundles, resulting in a uniform orientational distribution of the molecules around the gold nanocrystallites. From the inflection points in the calculated caloric curves, melting temperatures were determined as 280 and 294 K for the monolayers adsorbed on the smaller and larger gold nanocrystallites, respectively. These temperatures are significantly lower than the melting temperature estimated for a self-assembled monolayer of dodecanethiol adsorbed on an extended Au(111) surface. The theoretically predicted disordering mechanisms and melting scenario, resulting in a temperature-broadened transition, support recent experimental investigations. },

	Abstract = {Nanoparticles which consist of a plasmonic layer and an iron oxide moiety could provide a promising platform for development of multimodal imaging and therapy approaches in future medicine. However, the feasibility of this platform has yet to be fully explored. In this study we demonstrated the use of gold-coated iron oxide hybrid nanoparticles for combined molecular specific MRI/optical imaging and photothermal therapy of cancer cells. The gold layer exhibits a surface plasmon resonance that provides optical contrast due to light scattering in the visible region and also presents a convenient surface for conjugating targeting moieties, while the iron oxide cores give strong T-2 (spin-spin relaxation time) contrast. The strong optical absorption of the plasmonic gold layer also makes these nanoparticles a promising agent for photothermal therapy. We synthesized hybrid nanoparticles which specifically target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a common biomarker for many epithelial cancers. We demonstrated molecular specific MRI and optical imaging in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we showed that receptor-mediated aggregation of anti-EGFR hybrid nanoparticles allows selective destruction of highly proliferative cancer cells using a nanosecond pulsed laser at 700 nm wavelength, a significant shift from the peak absorbance of isolated hybrid nanoparticles at 532 nm.},

The experimental results show that these nanofluids, containing a small amount of nanoparticles, have substantially higher thermal conductivities than the same liquids without nanoparticles. Comparisons between experiments and the Hamilton and Crosser model show that the model can predict the thermal conductivity of nanofluids containing large agglomerated Al2O3 particles. However, the model appears to be inadequate for nanofluids containing CuO particles. This suggests that not only particle shape but size is considered to be dominant in enhancing the thermal conductivity of nanofluids.},

	Abstract = {We investigate{,} using transient non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations{,} heat-transfer through nanometer-scale interfaces consisting of n-decane (2-12 nm diameter) droplets in water. Using computer simulation results of the temperature relaxation of the nanodroplet as a function of time we have computed the thermal conductivity and the interfacial conductance of the droplet and the droplet/water interface respectively. We find that the thermal conductivity of the n-decane droplets is insensitive to droplet size{,} whereas the interfacial conductance shows a strong dependence on the droplet radius. We rationalize this behavior in terms of a modification of the n-decane/water surface-tension with droplet curvature. This enhancement in interfacial conductance would contribute{,} in the case of a suspension{,} to an increase in the thermal conductivity with decreasing particle radius. This notion is consistent with recent experimental studies of nanofluids. We also investigate the accuracy of different diffusion equations to model the temperature relaxation in non stationary non equilibrium processes. We show that the modeling of heat transfer across a nanodroplet/fluid interface requires the consideration of the thermal conductivity of the nanodroplet as well as the temperature discontinuity across the interface. The relevance of this result in diffusion models that neglect thermal conductivity effects in the modeling of the temperature relaxation is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Amphiphilic cyclodextrins (CDs) modified in the upper rim with thiohexyl groups and in the lower rim with oligoethylene amino (SC6NH2) or oligoethylene hydroxyl groups (SC6OH) can bind gold colloids, yielding Au/CD particles with an average hydrodynamic radius (RH) of 2 and 25 rim in water solution. The systems were investigated by UV-vis, quasi-elastic light scattering, and FTIR-ATR techniques. The concentration of amphiphiles was kept above the concentration of gold colloids to afford complete covering. In the case of SC6NH2, basic conditions (Et3N, pH 11) yield promptly the decoration of Au, which can be stabilized by linkage of CD amino and/or thioether groups. The critical aggregation concentration of SC6NH2 was measured (similar to 4 mu M) by surface tension measurements, pointing out that about 50\% of CDs are present in nonaggregated form. Whereas Au/SC6NH2 colloids were stable in size and morphology for at least one month, the size of the Au/SC6OH system increases remarkably, forming nanoaggregates of 20 and 80 rim in two hours. Under physiological conditions, the gold/amino amphiphiles system can internalize in HeLa cells, as shown by extinction spectra registered on the immobilized cells. The gold delivered by cyclodextrins can induce photothermal damage upon irradiation, doubling the cell mortality with respect to uncovered gold colloids. These findings can open useful perspectives to the application of these self-assembled systems in cancer photothermal therapy.},

                  periodic boundary conditions, conservation of total
                  energy and total linear momentum, and the sampling
                  of a rapidly converging quantity (temperature
                  gradient) rather than a slowly converging one (heat
                  flux). The scheme is tested on the Lennard-Jones
                  fluid. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {A nonequilibrium method for calculating the shear
                  viscosity is presented. It reverses the
                  cause-and-effect picture customarily used in
                  nonequilibrium molecular dynamics: the effect, the
                  momentum flux or stress, is imposed, whereas the
                  cause, the velocity gradient or shear rate, is
                  obtained from the simulation. It differs from other
                  Norton-ensemble methods by the way in which the
                  steady-state momentum flux is maintained. This
                  method involves a simple exchange of particle
                  momenta, which is easy to implement. Moreover, it
                  can be made to conserve the total energy as well as
                  the total linear momentum, so no coupling to an
                  external temperature bath is needed. The resulting
                  raw data, the velocity profile, is a robust and
                  rapidly converging property. The method is tested on
                  the Lennard-Jones fluid near its triple point. It
                  yields a viscosity of 3.2-3.3, in Lennard-Jones
                  reduced units, in agreement with literature
                  results. {[}S1063-651X(99)03105-0].},

	Abstract = { Systems with nanoscopic features contain a high density of interfaces. Thermal transport in such systems can be governed by the resistance to heat transfer, the Kapitza resistance (RK), at the interface. Although soft interfaces, such as those between immiscible liquids or between a biomolecule and solvent, are ubiquitous, few studies of thermal transport at such interfaces have been reported. Here we characterize the interfacial conductance, 1/RK, of soft interfaces as a function of molecular architecture, chemistry, and the strength of cross-interfacial intermolecular interactions through detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The conductance of various interfaces studied here, for example, water−organic liquid, water−surfactant, surfactant−organic liquid, is relatively high (in the range of 65−370 MW/m2 K) compared to that for solid−liquid interfaces (∼10 MW/m2 K). Interestingly, the dependence of interfacial conductance on the chemistry and molecular architecture cannot be explained solely in terms of either bulk property mismatch or the strength of intermolecular attraction between the two phases. The observed trends can be attributed to a combination of strong cross-interface intermolecular interactions and good thermal coupling via soft vibration modes present at liquid−liquid interfaces. },

	Abstract = {This paper describes our recent time-resolved spectroscopy studies of the properties of gold particles at high laser excitation levels. In these experiments, an intense pump laser pulse rapidly heats the particle, creating very high lattice temperatures - up to the melting point of bulk gold. These high temperatures can have dramatic effects on the particle and the surroundings. The lattice temperature created is determined by observing the coherently excited the vibrational modes of the particles. The periods of these modes depend on temperature, thus, they act as an internal thermometer. We have used these experiments to provide values for the threshold temperatures for explosive boiling of the solvent surrounding the particles, and laser induced structural transformations in non-spherical particles. The results of these experiments are relevant to the use of metal nanoparticles in photothermal therapy, where laser induced heating is used to selectively kill cells.},

   correctly predict the shear viscosity. The simulation setting and
   choice of the force field are discussed in detail. The all-atom force
   field exhibits a bad convergence and the shear viscosity is
   overestimated, while the simple united atom model predicts the kinetics
   very well. The results are compared with the equilibrium molecular

	Abstract = {The reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
                  (RNEMD) method calculates the shear viscosity of a
                  fluid by imposing a nonphysical exchange of momentum
                  and measuring the resulting shear velocity
                  gradient. In this study we investigate the range of
                  momentum flux values over which RNEMD yields usable
                  (linear) velocity gradients. We find that nonlinear
                  velocity profiles result primarily from gradients in
                  fluid temperature and density. The temperature
                  gradient results from conversion of heat into bulk
                  kinetic energy, which is transformed back into heat
                  elsewhere via viscous heating. An expression is
                  derived to predict the temperature profile resulting
                  from a specified momentum flux for a given fluid and
                  simulation cell. Although primarily bounded above,
                  we also describe milder low-flux limitations. RNEMD
                  results for a Lennard-Jones fluid agree with
                  equilibrium molecular dynamics and conventional
                  nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations at
                  low shear, but RNEMD underpredicts viscosity
                  relative to conventional NEMD at high shear.},

	Abstract = {A method for fast calculation of viscosity from molecular dynamics simulation is revisited. The method consists of using a steady-state periodic perturbation. A methodology to choose the amplitude of the external perturbation, which is one of the major practical issues in the original technique of Gosling et al. {$[$}Mol. Phys. 26: 1475 (1973){$]$} is proposed. The amplitude of the perturbation required for fast caculations and the viscosity values for wide ranges of temperature and density of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) model fluid are reported. The viscosity results are in agreement with recent LJ viscosity calculations. Additionally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable to efficiently generate viscosity data of good quality.},

	Abstract = {At the level of individual molecules, familiar concepts of heat transport no longer apply. When large amounts of heat are transported through a molecule, a crucial process in molecular electronic devices, energy is carried by discrete molecular vibrational excitations. We studied heat transport through self-assembled monolayers of long-chain hydrocarbon molecules anchored to a gold substrate by ultrafast heating of the gold with a femtosecond laser pulse. When the heat reached the methyl groups at the chain ends, a nonlinear coherent vibrational spectroscopy technique detected the resulting thermally induced disorder. The flow of heat into the chains was limited by the interface conductance. The leading edge of the heat burst traveled ballistically along the chains at a velocity of 1 kilometer per second. The molecular conductance per chain was 50 picowatts per kelvin.},

The thermal decay of alkanethiol-terminated Au nanoparticles in toluene is partially obscured by other effects; we set a lower limit G>20 MW m(-2)K(-1). The thermal decay of citrate-stabilized Pt nanoparticles in water gives Gapproximate to130 MW m(-2) K-1. AuPd alloy nanoparticles in toluene and stabilized by alkanethiol termination give Gapproximate to5 MW m(-2) K-1.

	Abstract = {Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in which a temperature gradient is imposed, we study how the ordering of the liquid at the liquid-solid interface affects the interfacial thermal resistance. Our simulations of a simple monoatomic liquid show no effect on the thermal transport either normal to the surface or parallel to the surface. Even for of a liquid that is highly confined between two solids, we find no effect on thermal conductivity. This contrasts with well-known significant effect of confinement on the viscoelastic response. Our findings suggest that the experimentally observed large enhancement of thermal conductivity in suspensions of solid nanosized particles (nanofluids) can not be explained by altered thermal transport properties of the layered liquid.

	Abstract = {Using molecular dynamics computer simulation, we have calculated the velocity autocorrelation function and diffusion constant for a spherical solute in a dense fluid of spherical solvent particles. The size and mass of the solute particle are related in such a way that we can naturally approach the Brownian limit (when the solute becomes much larger and more massive than the solvent particles). We find that as long as the solute radius is interpreted as an effective hydrodynamic radius, the Stokes-Einstein law with slip boundary conditions is satisfied as the Brownian limit is approached (specifically, when the solute is roughly 100 times more massive than the solvent particles). In contrast, the Stokes-Einstein law is not satisfied for a tagged particle of the neat solvent. We also find that in the Brownian limit the amplitude of the long-time tail of the solute's velocity autocorrelation function is in good agreement with theoretical hydrodynamic predictions. When the solvent density is substantially lower than the triple density, the Stokes-Einstein law is no longer satisfied, and the amplitude of the long-time tail is not in good agreement with theoretical predictions, signaling the breakdown of hydrodynamics.

We explore the effects of surface roughness of the solute on the resulting hydrodynamic boundary condition as we naturally approach the Brownian limit (when the solute becomes much larger and more massive than the solvent particles). We find that when the solute and solvent interact through a purely repulsive isotropic potential, in the Brownian limit the Stokes-Einstein law is satisfied with slip boundary conditions. However, when surface roughness is introduced through an anisotropic solute-solvent interaction potential, we find that the Stokes-Einstein law is satisfied with stick boundary conditions. In addition, when the attractive strength of a short-range isotropic solute-solvent potential is increased, the solute becomes dressed with solvent particles, making it effectively rough, and so stick boundary conditions are again recovered.},

	Abstract = {Frequently, data in scientific computing is in its abstract form a finite point set in space, and it is sometimes useful or required to compute what one might call the ''shape'' of the set. For that purpose, this article introduces the formal notion of the family of alpha-shapes of a finite point set in R3. Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter alpha is-an-element-of R controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size n in time O(n2), worst case. A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed, and several applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.},

Our simulations reveal that the strength of the bonding between liquid and solid atoms plays a key role in determining interfacial thermal resistance. Moreover, we find that the functional dependence of the thermal resistance on the strength of the liquid-solid interactions exhibits two distinct regimes: (i) exponential dependence for weak bonding (nonwetting liquid) and (ii) power law dependence for strong bonding (wetting liquid). The identification of the two regimes of the Kapitza resistance has profound implications for understanding and designing the thermal properties of nanocomposite materials.

	Abstract = {Two simple models are developed to accurately account for short-range solvation effects in molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecular systems in water. The methods limit the amount of solvent that must be treated explicitly to two or three solvation shells, thereby eliminating the need for periodic boundary conditions, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. In the dynamic boundary model, a confining potential is imposed on the solvent that responds dynamically to fluctuations in the solvent distribution and conformations of the biomolecular solute. In the exchange boundary solvation model, the molecules at the surface of the explicit solvation shell are allowed to undergo pairwise exchanges with the bulk to maintain a uniform hydration of the solute. The models are used to study the solvation thermodynamics of a 11-residue polyalanine helix in water. A broad range of structural and dynamic properties characterizing both the protein and the surrounding solvent are computed. Comparison with the results obtained from conventional periodic boundary condition simulations shows excellent agreement, and the new solvation models are found to improve computational efficiency by up two orders of magnitude.

	Abstract = {We present a method for simulating clusters or, molecules subjected to an external pressure, which is exerted by a pressure-transmitting medium. It is based on the canoninical Langevin thermostat, but extended in such a way that the Brownian forces are allowed to operate only from the region exterior to the cluster. We show that the frictional force of the Langevin thermostat is linked to the pressure of the reservoir in a unique way, and that this property manifests itself when the particle it acts upon is not pointlike but has finite dimensions. By choosing appropriately the strength of the random forces and the friction coefficient, both temperature and pressure can be controlled independently. We illustrate the capabilities of this new method by calculating the compressibility of small gold clusters under pressure.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: A new approach is developed to study the dynamics of the localized process in solutions and other condensed phase systems. The approach employs a fluctuating elastic boundary (FEB) model which encloses the simulated system in an elastic bag that mimics the effects of the bulk solvent. This alleviates the need for periodic boundary conditions and allows for a reduction in the number of solvent molecules that need to be included in the simulation. The boundary bag is modeled as a mesh of quasi-particles connected by elastic bonds. The FEB model allows for volume and density fluctuations characteristic of the bulk system, and the shape of the boundary fluctuates during the course of the simulation to adapt to the configuration fluctuations of the explicit solute-solvent system inside. The method is applied to the simulation of a Lennard-Jones model of liquid argon. Various structural and dynamical quantities are computed and compared with those obtained from conventional periodic boundary simulations. The agreement between the two is excellent in most cases, thus validating the viability of the FEB method.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for isothermal-isobaric molecular-dynamics simulation. The method uses an extended Hamiltonian with an Andersen piston combined with the Nose-Poincare thermostat, recently developed by Bond, Leimkuhler, and Laird [J. Comp. Phys. 151, 114 (1999)]. This Nose-Poincare-Andersen (NPA) formulation has advantages over the Nose-Hoover-Andersen approach in that the NPA is Hamiltonian and can take advantage of symplectic integration schemes, which lead to enhanced stability for long-time simulations. The equations of motion are integrated using a generalized leapfrog algorithm (GLA) and the method is easy to implement, symplectic, explicit, and time reversible. To demonstrate the superior stability of the method we show results for test simulations using a model for aluminum and compare it to a recently developed time-reversible algorithm for Nose-Hoover-Anderson. In addition, an extension of the NPA to multiple time steps is outlined and a symplectic and time-reversible integration algorithm, based on the GLA, is given. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

	Abstract = {A new method for performing molecular dynamics simulations under constant pressure is presented. In the method, which is based on the extended system formalism introduced by Andersen, the deterministic equations of motion for the piston degree of freedom are replaced by a Langevin equation; a suitable choice of collision frequency then eliminates the unphysical ''ringing'' of the volume associated with the piston mass. In this way it is similar to the ''weak coupling algorithm'' developed by Berendsen and co-workers to perform molecular dynamics simulation without piston mass effects. It is shown, however, that the weak coupling algorithm induces artifacts into the simulation which can be quite severe for inhomogeneous systems such as aqueous biopolymers or liquid/liquid interfaces.},

We demonstrate that the corresponding equations of motion lead to the relevant ensembles and propose an appropriate scheme of integration. After having identified a suitable set of parameters for the approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by applying it to two different systems, a simple isotropic fluid and an anisotropic fluid lipid-bilayer membrane in water. Results are presented for, respectively, isothermal bulk compressibility, tracer diffusion coefficient, lipid head-group area, and isothermal area compressibility. We find that our Langevin piston approach leads to improvements over other approaches in terms of faster equilibration and shorter correlation times of various system variables.},

@article{King1989,
	Abstract = {A consistent simulation of ionic or strongly polar solutes in polar solvents presents a major challenge from both fundamental and practical aspects. The frequently used method of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) does not correctly take into account the symmetry of the solute field. Instead of using PBC, it is natural to model this type of system as a sphere (with the solute at the origin), but the boundary conditions to be used in such a model are not obvious. Early calculations performed with our surface constrained soft sphere dipoles (SCSSD) model indicated that the dipoles near the surface ofthe sphere will show unusual orientational preferences (they will overpolarize) unless a corrective force is included in the model, and thus we implemented polarization constraints in this spherical model of polar solutions. More recent approaches that treated the surface with stochastic dynamics, but did not take into account the surface polarization effects, were also found to exhibit these nonphysical orientational preferences. The present work develops a surface constrained all- atom solvent (SCAAS) model in order to consistently treat the surface polarization effects in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The SCAAS model, which was presented in a preliminary way in previous works, introduces surface constraints as boundary conditions in order to make the necessarily finite system behave as if it was part of an infinite system. The performance of the model with regard to various properties of bulk water is examined by comparing its results to those obtained by PBC simulations. The results obtained from SCAAS models of different sizes are found to be similar to each other and to the corresponding PBC results. The performance of the model in simulations of solvated ions is emphasized and a comparison of the results obtained with spheres of different sizes demonstrates that the model does not possess significant size dependence. This indicates that the model can be used with a relatively small number of solvent molecules for convergent simulation of structure, energetics, and dynamics of polar solutions. The much simpler fixed center Langevin dipoles (FCLD) model is also examined and found to provide a powerful tool for estimating solvation free energies. Finally, a preliminary study of the dielectric properties of the SCAAS model is reported and the potential of this model for exploring the correct implementation of the solvent reaction field is discussed.},

The surfaces p.rodu~edensity oscillations that extend at lea~t 10 A into the liquid, and slgmficant molecular onentatlOnal preferences that extend at least 7 A into the liquid. The liquid structure nearest the surface is characterized by "dangling" hydrogen bonds; i.e., a typical water molecule at the surface has one potentially hydrogen-bonding group oriented toward the hydrophobic surface. This surface arrangement represents a balance between the tendencies of the liquid to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds on the one hand, and to maximize the packing density of the molecules on the other. A detailed analysis shows that the structural properties of the liquid farther from the surface can be understood as effects imposed by this surface structure. These results show that the hydration structure of large hydrophobic surfaces
can be very different from that of small hydrophobic molecules.},

@article{Bagchi1997,
	Abstract = {Constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics calculations have been performed on the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model water to understand the effects of pressure on its structural and dynamical properties. The effect of pressure is to increase the presence of interstitial water molecules, which is shown to be responsible for the experimentally observed increase in the first x-ray diffraction peak and a broadening of the OdOO bond angle distribution. These structural changes lead to weaker hydrogen bonding and the observed minimum in the rotational correlation time as a function of pressure. The weak maximum in the measured translational diffusion coefficient at around 1.5 kbar was not reproduced. The temperature of the density maximum was estimated to occur at 245￿4 K, which suggests that structural changes with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature are not quantitatively reproduced by the SPC/E model.	{\copyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.

@article{Stillinger1974,
	Abstract = {The technique of computer simulation by molecular dynamics has been used to investigate highly compressed water at mass density 1.346 glcm3. The calculations involve 216 rigid molecules, subject to an additive interaction (the "ST2 potential") whose strong anisotropic character has been shown to describe the hydrogen bond phenomenon. In the light of previous calculations on the same model at ordinary pressures, substantial restructuring of the liquid in response to compression is obvious. No evidence arises to support description of the liquid in terms of crystal structures of ices VI and VII, the solid forms that might be expected to be relevant at the chosen density. The calculations indicate that the initial effect of pressure increase (at I atm) leads to increased fluidity, as is known to be the case for real water.},

	Abstract = {Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations have been carried out with the TIP3P, SPC, and TIP4P models for liquid water at 13 temperatures from 􏰮50􏰯C to 100􏰯C at 1 atm. Long runs with 512 water molecules provided definitive results for densities. Although the TIP4P model yields a flat region in the density profile and a temperature of maximum density near 􏰮15􏰯C, the SPC and TIP3P models show monotonically increasing density with decreasing temperature. Results for heats of vaporization, isothermal compressibilities, and coefficients of thermal expansion and their convergence characteristics are also reported.	􏰱 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	Abstract = {The melting point of ice Ih for the TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew and TIP5P models has been determined by computer simulation. It has been found that the melting points of ice Ih for these models are 146, 190, 215, 232, 245 and 274 K respectively. Thus from the models of water available so far only TIP5P reproduces the experimental melting point of water. The relative stability of ice II with respect to ice Ih at the normal melting point has also been considered. Ice II is more stable than ice Ih for the TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E and TIP5P models. Only for the TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew models is ice Ih more stable than ice II at low pressures. The complete phase diagram for the SPC/E, TIP4P and TIP5P models has been computed. It has been found that SPC/E and TIP5P do not correctly describe the phase diagram of water. However, TIP4P provides a qualitatively correct description of the phase diagram of water. A slight modification of the parameters of the TIP4P model yields a new model, denoted as TIP4P/ice, which reproduces the experimental melting point of water and provides an excellent description of the densities of all ice phases.},

	Abstract = {Monte Carlo computer simulations with the TIP4P intermolecular potential are performed in 9 thermodynamic states of compressed liquid water along the 298 K isotherm. Two distinct pressure ranges are found in the pressure dependence of the O-O near-neighbor distances in qualitative agreement with the X-ray diffraction data. Nevertheless, the experimentally observed minimum in this dependence is not reproduced by the present simulations. The evolution of hydrogen-bonded network in liquid water under gradual compression is quantitatively analyzed using the combined geometric and energetic criterion of hydrogen bonding. Despite some bending and weakening of the existing hydrogen bonds, the average topology of the H-bonded network remains intact, and the average number of hydrogen bonds per a water molecule remains constant ((nrm) = 3.2) over the whole pressure range studied, while the increase in density is mainly achieved by an increased packing efficiency of non-bonded nearest and second nearest neighbors.},

	Abstract = { A general theory is presented for determining the quasistatic Stokes resistance of a particle or an aggregate of particles of arbitrary shape which move with arbitrary translational and rotational velocities in an infinite viscous fluid subjected to a general linear shear flow in the absence of the particles. It is shown that the hydrodynamic resistance of the particles may be characterized by two intrinsic matrices-the grand resistance matrix and the shear resistance matrix, the elements of each matrix being dependent only upon the instantaneous geometrical configuration of the multiparticle system. Explicit expressions for these matrix elements are given for a single ellipsoidal particle and for two spheres. Analytical, closed-form expressions are given for the case where the spheres are widely spaced compared with their radii. When the separation between the spheres is arbitrary, the matrix elements are only determinate numerically for specified ratios of sphere radii and center-to-center separation distances. These numerical values are derived from available bipolar-coordinate system solutions for two spheres. Besides providing a compact and systematic representation of the intrinsic Stokes resistance of multiparticle systems subjected to shear, which does not depend upon the precise velocities of the particles or on the nature of the shear flow, it is demonstrated (by way of example) that the matrix representation permits an immediate determination of the translational and rotational velocities of the individual particles in a neutrally buoyant multiparticle system.},

	Abstract = {The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation describing the dynamics of a single Brownian particle near a fixed external surface is derived using the multiple-time-scales perturbation method, previously used by Cukier and Deutch and Nienhuis in the absence of any external surfaces, and Piasecki ei LII. for two Brownian spheres in a hard fluid. The FP equation includes an explicit expression for the (time-independent) particle friction tensor in terms of the force autocorrelation Function and equilibrium average force on the particle by the surrounding fluid and in the presence of a fixed external surface. such as an adsorbate. The scaling and perturbation analysis given here also shows that the Force autocorrelation function must decay rapidly on the zeroth-order time scale tau(0), which physically requires N-Kn much less than 1, where N-Kn is the Knudsen number (ratio of the length scale for fluid intermolecular interactions to the Brownian particle length scale). This restricts the theory given here to liquid systems where N-Kn much less than 1. For a specified particle configuration with respect to the external surface, equilibrium canonical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations are conducted, as shown here, in order to obtain numerical values of the friction tensor from the force autocorrelation expression. Molecular dynamics computations of the friction tensor for a single spherical particle in the absence of a fixed external surface are shown to recover Stokes' law for various types of fluid molecule-particle interaction potentials. Analytical studies of the static force correlation function also demonstrate the remarkable principle of force-time parity whereby the particle friction coefficient is nearly independent of the fluid molecule-particle interaction potential. Molecular dynamics computations of the friction tensor for a single spherical particle near a fixed external spherical surface (adsorbate) demonstrate a breakdown in continuum hydrodynamic results at close particle surface separation distances on the order of several molecular diameters.},

Phys. 94, 557 (1999)], the Smoluchowski diffusion equation is derived here to describe the spatial and orientational dynamics of molecularly structured macromolecules near molecularly structured surfaces. The formal scaling and perturbation methods employed allow the establishment of definite limits on the use of the Smoluchowski equation when surfaces are present. It is shown that the Smoluchowski equation reduces to that given previously [D. W. Condiff and J. S. Dahler, J. Chem. Phys. 44, 3988 (1966)] in the absence of external surfaces. A specific example application is given involving a spherical macromolecule with electrostatic charge segments near a planar surface with an arbitrary charge distribution. Finally, we show that the short-time solution to the Smoluchowski equation obtained here yields a Brownian dynamics method consistent with that given previously [E. Dickinson, S. A. Allison, and J. A. McCammon, J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 2 81, 591 (1985)] for orientable, interacting Brownian particles.

	Abstract = {A modeling approach that can significantly speed up the dynamics simulation of large molecular systems is presented herein. A multigranular modeling approach, whereby different parts of the molecule are modeled at different levels of detail, is enabled by substructuring. Substructuring the molecular system is accomplished by collecting groups of atoms into rigid or flexible bodies. Body flexibility is modeled by a truncated set of body-based modes. This approach allows for the elimination of the high-frequency harmonic motion while capturing the low-frequency anharmonic motion of interest. This results in the use of larger integration step sizes, substantially reducing the computational time required for a given dynamic simulation. The method also includes the use of a multiple time scale (MTS) integration scheme. Speed increases of 5- to 30-fold over atomistic simulations have been realized in various applications of the method. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to reduce the number of degrees of freedom necessary to describe a polypeptide chain we analyze the statistical behavior of polypeptide chains when represented as C alpha chains, C alpha chains with C beta atoms attached, and C alpha chains with rotational ellipsoids as models of side chains. A statistical analysis on a restricted data set of 75 unrelated protein structures is performed. The comparison of the database distributions with those obtained by model calculation on very short polypeptide stretches allows the dissection of local versus nonlocal features of the distributions. The database distribution of the bend angles of polypeptide chains of pseudo bonded C alpha atoms spans a restricted range of values and shows a bimodal structure. On the other hand, the torsion angles of the C alpha chain may assume almost all possible values. The distribution is bimodal, but with a much broader probability distribution than for bend angles. The C alpha - C beta vectors may be taken as representative of the orientation of the lateral chain, as the direction of the bond is close to the direction of the vector joining C alpha to the ad hoc defined center of the "steric mass" of the side chain. Interestingly, both the bend angle defined by C alpha i-C alpha i+1-C beta i+1 and the torsional angle offset of the pseudo-dihedral C alpha i-C alpha i+1-C alpha i+2-C beta i+2 with respect to C alpha i-C alpha i+1-C alpha i+2-C alpha i+3 span a limited range of values. The latter results show that it is possible to give a more realistic representation of polypeptide chains without introducing additional degrees of freedom, i.e., by just adding to the C alpha chain a C beta with given side-chain properties. However, a more realistic description of side chains may be attained by modeling side chains as rotational ellipsoids that have roughly the same orientation and steric hindrance. To this end, we define the steric mass of an atom as proportional to its van der Waals volume and we calculate the side-chain inertia ellipsoid assuming that the steric mass of each atom is uniformly distributed within its van der Waals volume. Finally, we define the rotational ellipsoid representing the side chain as the uniform density ellipsoid possessing the same rotationally averaged inertia tensor of the side chain. The statistics of ellipsoid parameters support the possibility of representing a side chain via an ellipsoid, independently of the local conformation. To make this description useful for molecular modeling we describe ellipsoid-ellipsoid interactions via a Lennard-Jones potential that preserves the repulsive core of the interacting ellipsoids and takes into account their mutual orientation. Tests are performed for two different forms of the interaction potential on a set of high-resolution protein structures. Results are encouraging, in view of the drastic simplifications that were introduced.},

	Abstract = {Detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the rotational and the translational motions of Gay-Berne ellipsoids in a sea of Lennard-Jones spheres have been carried out. It is found that while the translational motion of an ellipsoid is isotropic at low density, it becomes increasingly anisotropic with density until the ratio of the parallel to the perpendicular diffusion coefficients becomes nearly equal to the value of the aspect ratio at high density. The latter is in agreement with the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics with slip boundary condition. The product of the translational diffusion coefficient and the rotational correlation time also attains a hydrodynamic-like density independent behavior only at high density. The reorientational correlation function becomes nonexponential at high density and low temperature where it also develops a slow decay. The perpendicular component of the velocity time correlation function exhibits a clear double minimum, only at high density, which becomes more pronounced as the aspect ratio is increased.

	Abstract = {Translational friction coefficients of hard prolate ellipsoids (having aspect ratios of 1-10) have been calculated by solving the linearized Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics, using the method of Faxen's theorem. When the stick boundary condition was used, the present results reproduce the famous work of Lamb. The new information derived from this study arises from the analysis of the friction under the influence of the slip hydrodynamic boundary condition. It was found that the slip friction perpendicular to the long axis of the prolate ellipsoid increases monotonically with aspect ratio, whereas the parallel component of the friction decreases monotonically to an apparent limiting value. The ratio f(perpendicular to)/f(parallel to) of friction coefficients perpendicular and parallel to the long axis of the particle, calculated using slip hydrodynamics, scales roughly as the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid, in accord with the findings from an Enskog (uncorrelated binary collision) kinetic theory of hard ellipsoids and from the estimate derived from molecular dynamics. In contrast, f(perpendicular to)/f(parallel to) derived by means of stick hydrodynamics shows a weak dependence on the aspect ratio and disagrees with kinetic theory and molecular dynamics findings.},

Form factors F(qz) are obtained from a combination of two sample preparations, oriented stacks of bilayers for qz extending to 0.85 A-1 and unilamellar vesicles for smaller qz. Modeling obtains the electron density profile and values for the area per molecule, for the locations of the component groups, and for the different types of thicknesses of the bilayer, such as the hydrocarbon thickness and the steric thickness.

	Abstract = {The plasma membrane of cells is an ordered environment, giving rise to anisotropic orientation and restricted motion of molecules and proteins residing in the membrane. At the same time as being an organized matrix of defined structure, the cell membrane is heterogeneous and dynamic. Here we present a method where we use fluorescence imaging of linear dichroism to measure the orientation of molecules relative to the cell membrane. By detecting linear dichroism as well as fluorescence anisotropy, the orientation parameters are separated from dynamic properties such as rotational diffusion and homo energy transfer (energy migration). The sensitivity of the technique is enhanced by using two-photon excitation for higher photo-selection compared to single photon excitation. We show here that we can accurately image lipid organization in whole cell membranes and in delicate structures such as membrane nanotubes connecting two cells. The speed of our wide-field imaging system makes it possible to image changes in orientation and anisotropy occurring on a subsecond timescale. This is demonstrated by time-lapse studies showing that cholesterol depletion rapidly disrupts the orientation of a fluorophore located within the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane but not of a surface bound probe. This is consistent with cholesterol having an important role in stabilizing and ordering the lipid tails within the plasma membrane. },

	Abstract = {Quantitative structures of the fully hydrated fluid phases of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) were obtained at 30{degrees}C. Data for the relative form factors F(qz) for DMPC were obtained using a combination of four methods. 1), Volumetric data provided F(0). 2), Diffuse x-ray scattering from oriented stacks of bilayers provided relative form factors |F(qz)| for high qz, 0.22 < qz < 0.8 A-1. 3), X-ray scattering from extruded unilamellar vesicles with diameter 600 A provided |F(qz)| for low qz, 0.1 < qz < 0.3 A-1. 4), Previous measurements using a liquid crystallographic x-ray method provided |F(2{pi}h/D)| for h = 1 and 2 for a range of nearly fully hydrated D-spacings. The data from method 4 overlap and validate the new unilamellar vesicles data for DMPC, so method 4 is not required for DLPC or future studies. We used hybrid electron density models to obtain structural results from these form factors. Comparison of the model electron density profiles with that of gel phase DMPC provides areas per lipid A, 60.6 {+/-} 0.5 A2 for DMPC and 63.2 {+/-} 0.5 A2 for DLPC. Constraints on the model provided by volume measurements and component volumes obtained from simulations put the electron density profiles {rho}(z) and the corresponding form factors F(qz) on absolute scales. Various thicknesses, such as the hydrophobic thickness and the steric thickness, are obtained and compared to literature values.

We show that changing the dipole position and orientation has a profound effect on the mesophase stability and molecular organization. In particular, we find a uniaxial nematic phase only for off-center dipolar models and tilted phases only for the one with terminal dipoles.},

	Abstract = {The equivalent radius for any solution property is the radius of a spherical particle having the same value of solution property as that of the macromolecule under consideration. Equivalent radii for different properties present a dependence on size and shape that are more similar than the values of the properties themselves. Furthermore, the ratios of equivalent radii of two properties depend on the conformation (shape or flexibility), but not on the absolute sizes. We define equivalent radii and their ratios, and describe their evaluation for some common models of rigid and flexible macromolecules. Using radii and ratios, we have devised procedures to fit macromolecular models to experimental properties, allowing the determination of the model parameters. Using these quantities, we can construct target functions for an equilibrated, unbiased optimization. The procedures, which have been implemented in public-domain computer programs, are illustrated for rigid, globular proteins, and the rodlike tobacco mosaic virus, and for semiflexible, wormlike heparin molecules.},

	Abstract = {While the prediction of hydrodynamic properties of rigid particles
    is nowadays feasible using simple and efficient computer programs,
    the calculation of such properties and, in general, the dynamic
    behavior of flexible macromolecules has not reached a similar situation.
    Although the theories are available, usually the computational work
    is done using solutions specific for each problem. We intend to
    develop computer programs that would greatly facilitate the task
    of predicting solution behavior of flexible macromolecules. In this
    paper, we first present an overview of the two approaches that are
    most practical: the Monte Carlo rigid-body treatment, and the Brownian
    dynamics simulation technique. The Monte Carlo procedure is based
    on the calculation of properties for instantaneous conformations
    of the macromolecule that are regarded as if they were instantaneously
    rigid. We describe how a Monte Carlo program can be interfaced to
    the programs in the HYDRO suite for rigid particles, and provide
    an example of such calculation, for a hypothetical particle: a protein
    with two domains connected by a flexible linker. We also describe
    briefly the essentials of Brownian dynamics, and propose a general
    mechanical model that includes several kinds of intramolecular interactions,
    such as bending, internal rotation, excluded volume effects, etc.
    We provide an example of the application of this methodology to
    the dynamics of a semiflexible, wormlike DNA.},

@article{Alakent2005,
	Abstract = {Time series analysis tools are employed on the principal modes obtained
    from the C-alpha trajectories from two independent molecular-dynamics
    simulations of alpha-amylase inhibitor (tendamistat). Fluctuations
    inside an energy minimum (intraminimum motions), transitions between
    minima (interminimum motions), and relaxations in different hierarchical
    energy levels are investigated and compared with those encountered
    in vacuum by using different sampling window sizes and intervals.
    The low-frequency low-indexed mode relationship, established in
    vacuum, is also encountered in water, which shows the reliability
    of the important dynamics information offered by principal components
    analysis in water. It has been shown that examining a short data
    collection period (100 ps) may result in a high population of overdamped
    modes, while some of the low-frequency oscillations (< 10 cm(-1))
    can be captured in water by using a longer data collection period
    (1200 ps). Simultaneous analysis of short and long sampling window
    sizes gives the following picture of the effect of water on protein
    dynamics. Water makes the protein lose its memory: future conformations
    are less dependent on previous conformations due to the lowering
    of energy barriers in hierarchical levels of the energy landscape.
    In short-time dynamics (< 10 ps), damping factors extracted from
    time series model parameters are lowered. For tendamistat, the friction
    coefficient in the Langevin equation is found to be around 40-60
    cm(-1) for the low-indexed modes, compatible with literature. The
    fact that water has increased the friction and that on the other
    hand has lubrication effect at first sight contradicts. However,
    this comes about because water enhances the transitions between
    minima and forces the protein to reduce its already inherent inability
    to maintain oscillations observed in vacuum. Some of the frequencies
    lower than 10 cm(-1) are found to be overdamped, while those higher
    than 20 cm(-1) are slightly increased. As for the long-time dynamics
    in water, it is found that random-walk motion is maintained for
    approximately 200 ps (about five times of that in vacuum) in the
    low-indexed modes, showing the lowering of energy barriers between
    the higher-level minima.},

	Abstract = {Acetylcholine receptor channels (AChRs) are proteins that switch between
    stable #closed# and #open# conformations. In patch clamp recordings,
    diliganded AChR gating appears to be a simple, two-state reaction.
    However, mutagenesis studies indicate that during gating dozens
    of residues across the protein move asynchronously and are organized
    into rigid body gating domains (#blocks#). Moreover, there is an
    upper limit to the apparent channel opening rate constant. These
    observations suggest that the gating reaction has a broad, corrugated
    transition state region, with the maximum opening rate reflecting,
    in part, the mean first-passage time across this ensemble. Simulations
    reveal that a flat, isotropic energy profile for the transition
    state can account for many of the essential features of AChR gating.
    With this mechanism, concerted, local structural transitions that
    occur on the broad transition state ensemble give rise to fractional
    measures of reaction progress (Phi values) determined by rate-equilibrium
    free energy relationship analysis. The results suggest that the
    coarse-grained AChR gating conformational change propagates through

    scheme LIN. LN combines force linearization with force splitting
    techniques and disposes of LIN'S computationally intensive minimization
    (anharmonic correction) component. Unlike the competitive multiple-timestepping
    (MTS) schemes today-formulated to be symplectic and time-reversible-LN
    merges the slow and fast forces via extrapolation rather than impulses;
    the Langevin heat bath prevents systematic energy drifts. This combination
    succeeds in achieving more significant speedups than these MTS methods
    which are Limited by resonance artifacts to an outer timestep less
    than some integer multiple of half the period of the fastest motion
    (around 4-5 fs for biomolecules). We show that LN achieves very
    good agreement with small-timestep solutions of the Langevin equation

    and dynamics (spectral densities) for two proteins in vacuum and
    a large water system. Significantly, the frequency of updating the

	Abstract = {Numerical simulations of fast remagnetization processes using stochastic
    dynamics are widely used to study various magnetic systems. In this
    paper, we first address several crucial methodological problems
    of such simulations: (i) the influence of finite-element discretization
    on simulated dynamics, (ii) choice between Ito and Stratonovich
    stochastic calculi by the solution of micromagnetic stochastic equations
    of motion and (iii) non-trivial correlation properties of the random
    (thermal) field. Next, we discuss several examples to demonstrate
    the great potential of the Langevin dynamics for studying fast remagnetization
    processes in technically relevant applications: we present numerical
    analysis of equilibrium magnon spectra in patterned structures,
    study thermal noise effects on the magnetization dynamics of nanoelements
    in pulsed fields and show some results for a remagnetization dynamics
    induced by a spin-polarized current. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

	Abstract = {Fluids of hard bent-core molecules have been studied using theory
    and computer simulation. The molecules are composed of two hard
    spherocylinders, with length-to-breadth ratio L/D, joined by their
    ends at an angle 180 degrees - gamma. For L/D = 2 and gamma = 0,10,20
    degrees, the simulations show isotropic, nematic, smectic, and solid
    phases. For L/D = 2 and gamma = 30 degrees, only isotropic, nematic,
    and solid phases are in evidence, which suggests that there is a
    nematic-smectic-solid triple point at an angle in the range 20 degrees
    < gamma < 30 degrees. In all of the orientationally ordered fluid
    phases the order is purely uniaxial. For gamma = 10 degrees and
    20 degrees, at the studied densities, the solid is also uniaxially
    ordered, whilst for gamma = 30 degrees the solid layers are biaxially
    ordered. For L/D = 2 and gamma = 60 degrees and 90 degrees we find
    no spontaneous orientational ordering. This is shown to be due to
    the interlocking of dimer pairs which precludes alignment. We find
    similar results for L/D = 9.5 and gamma = 72 degrees, where an isotropic-biaxial
    nematic transition is predicted by Onsager theory. Simulations in
    the biaxial nematic phase show it to be at least mechanically stable
    with respect to the isotropic phase, however. We have compared the
    quasi-exact simulation results in the isotropic phase with the predicted
    equations of state from three theories: the virial expansion containing
    the second and third virial coefficients; the Parsons-Lee equation
    of state; an application of Wertheim's theory of associating fluids
    in the limit of infinite attractive association energy. For all
    of the molecule elongations and geometries we have simulated, the
    Wertheim theory proved to be the most accurate. Interestingly, the
    isotropic equation of state is virtually independent of the dimer
    bond angle-a feature that is also reflected in the lack of variation
    with angle of the calculated second and third virial coefficients.

    place at the molecular surface, another possibility is to use shell
    models, as originally proposed by Bloomfield. In this work, we have

    the spectrum analytic, restores stability. The resulting Hamiltonian
    dictates that in addition to updating the momentum due to the slowly

	Abstract = {To explore the origin of the large-scale motion of triosephosphate
    isomerase's flexible loop (residues 166 to 176) at the active site,
    several simulation protocols are employed both for the free enzyme
    in vacuo and for the free enzyme with some solvent modeling: high-temperature
    Langevin dynamics simulations, sampling by a #dynamics##driver#
    approach, and potential-energy surface calculations. Our focus is
    on obtaining the energy barrier to the enzyme's motion and establishing
    the nature of the loop movement. Previous calculations did not determine
    this energy barrier and the effect of solvent on the barrier. High-temperature
    molecular dynamics simulations and crystallographic studies have
    suggested a rigid-body motion with two hinges located at both ends
    of the loop; Brownian dynamics simulations at room temperature pointed
    to a very flexible behavior. The present simulations and analyses
    reveal that although solute/solvent hydrogen bonds play a crucial
    role in lowering the energy along the pathway, there still remains
    a high activation barrier, This finding clearly indicates that,
    if the loop opens and closes in the absence of a substrate at standard
    conditions (e.g., room temperature, appropriate concentration of
    isomerase), the time scale for transition is not in the nanosecond
    but rather the microsecond range. Our results also indicate that
    in the context of spontaneous opening in the free enzyme, the motion
    is of rigid-body type and that the specific interaction between
    residues Ala(176) and Tyr(208) plays a crucial role in the loop
    opening/closing mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Rigid body molecular models possess symplectic structure and time-reversal
    symmetry. Standard numerical integration methods destroy both properties,
    introducing nonphysical dynamical behavior such as numerically induced
    dissipative states and drift in the energy during long term simulations.
    This article describes the construction, implementation, and practical
    application of fast explicit symplectic-reversible integrators for
    multiple rigid body molecular simulations, These methods use a reduction
    to Euler equations for the free rigid body, together with a symplectic
    splitting technique. In every time step, the orientational dynamics
    of each rigid body is integrated by a sequence of planar rotations.
    Besides preserving the symplectic and reversible structures of the
    flow, this scheme accurately conserves the total angular momentum
    of a system of interacting rigid bodies. Excellent energy conservation
    fan be obtained relative to traditional methods, especially in long-time
    simulations. The method is implemented in a research code, ORIENT
    and compared with a quaternion/extrapolation scheme for the TIP4P
    model of water. Our experiments show that the symplectic-reversible
    scheme is far superior to the more traditional quaternion method.

    A combination of microcanonical and isobaric-isothermal molecular

    In most cases, the use of the reaction field resulted in calculated
    densities which were significantly lower than experimental densities.
    Analysis of self-diffusion constants shows that the original SSD
    model captures the transport properties of experimental water very
    well in both the normal and supercooled liquid regimes. We also

	Abstract = {A new procedure for studying the folding and unfolding of proteins,
    with an application to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI),
    is reported. The unfolding and refolding of the native structure
    of the protein are characterized by the dimensions of the protein,
    expressed in terms of the three principal radii of the structure
    considered as an ellipsoid. A dynamic equation, describing the variations
    of the principal radii on the unfolding path, and a numerical procedure
    to solve this equation are proposed. Expanded and distorted conformations
    are refolded to the native structure by a dimensional-constraint
    energy minimization procedure. A unique and reproducible unfolding
    pathway for an intermediate of BPTI lacking the [30,51] disulfide
    bond is obtained. The resulting unfolded conformations are extended;
    they contain near-native local structure, but their longest principal
    radii are more than 2.5 times greater than that of the native structure.
    The most interesting finding is that the majority of expanded conformations,
    generated under various conditions, can be refolded closely to the
    native structure, as measured by the correct overall chain fold,
    by the rms deviations from the native structure of only 1.9-3.1
    angstrom, and by the energy differences of about 10 kcal/mol from
    the native structure. Introduction of the [30,51] disulfide bond
    at this stage, followed by minimization, improves the closeness
    of the refolded structures to the native structure, reducing the
    rms deviations to 0.9-2.0 angstrom. The unique refolding of these
    expanded structures over such a large conformational space implies
    that the folding is strongly dictated by the interactions in the
    amino acid sequence of BPTI. The simulations indicate that, under
    conditions that favor a compact structure as mimicked by the volume
    constraints in our algorithm; the expanded conformations have a
    strong tendency to move toward the native structure; therefore,
    they probably would be favorable folding intermediates. The results
    presented here support a general model for protein folding, i.e.,
    progressive formation of partially folded structural units, followed
    by collapse to the compact native structure. The general applicability
    of the procedure is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The slow dynamics of proteins around its native folded state is usually
    described by diffusion in a strongly anharmonic potential. In this
    paper, we try to understand the form and origin of the anharmonicities,
    with the principal aim of gaining a better understanding of the
    principal motion types, but also in order to develop more efficient
    numerical methods for simulating neutron scattering spectra of large
    proteins. First, we decompose a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory
    of 1.5 ns for a C-phycocyanin dimer surrounded by a layer of water
    into three contributions that we expect to be independent: the global
    motion of the residues, the rigid-body motion of the sidechains
    relative to the backbone, and the internal deformations of the sidechains.
    We show that they are indeed almost independent by verifying the
    factorization of the incoherent intermediate scattering function.
    Then, we show that the global residue motions, which include all
    large-scale backbone motions, can be reproduced by a simple harmonic
    model which contains two contributions: a short-time vibrational
    term, described by a standard normal mode calculation in a local
    minimum, and a long-time diffusive term, described by Brownian motion
    in an effective harmonic potential. The potential and the friction
    constants were fitted to the MD data. The major anharmonic contribution
    to the incoherent intermediate scattering function comes from the
    rigid-body diffusion of the sidechains. This model can be used to
    calculate scattering functions for large proteins and for long-time
    scales very efficiently, and thus provides a useful complement to
    MD simulations, which are best suited for detailed studies on smaller
    systems or for shorter time scales. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Ho1992,
	Abstract = {Evidence has been found for the existence water at the protein-lipid
    hydrophobic interface ot the membrane proteins, gramicidin and apocytochrome
    C, using two related fluorescence spectroscopic approaches. The
    first approach exploited the fact that the presence of water in
    the excited state solvent cage of a fluorophore increases the rate
    of decay. For 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[[2-[4-(6-phenyl-trans-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)
    phenyl]ethyl]carbonyl]-3-sn-PC (DPH-PC), where the fluorophores
    are located in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer, the introduction
    of gramicidin reduced the fluorescence lifetime, indicative of an
    increased presence of water in the bilayer. Since a high protein:lipid
    ratio was used, the fluorophores were forced to be adjacent to the
    protein hydrophobic surface, hence the presence of water in this
    region could be inferred. Cholesterol is known to reduce the water
    content of lipid bilayers and this effect was maintained at the
    protein-lipid interface with both gramicidin and apocytochrome C,
    again suggesting hydration in this region. The second approach was
    to use the fluorescence enhancement induced by exchanging deuterium
    oxide (D2O) for H2O. Both the fluorescence intensities of trimethylammonium-DPH,
    located in the lipid head group region, and of the gramicidin intrinsic
    tryptophans were greater in a D2O buffer compared with H2O, showing
    that the fluorophores were exposed to water in the bilayer at the
    protein-lipid interface. In the presence of cholesterol the fluorescence
    intensity ratio of D2O to H2O decreased, indicating a removal of
    water by the cholesterol, in keeping with the lifetime data. Altered
    hydration at the protein-lipid interface could affect conformation,
    thereby offering a new route by which membrane protein functioning
    may be modified.},

@article{Izaguirre2001,
	Abstract = {In this paper we show the possibility of using very mild stochastic
    damping to stabilize long time step integrators for Newtonian molecular
    dynamics. More specifically, stable and accurate integrations are
    obtained for damping coefficients that are only a few percent of
    the natural decay rate of processes of interest, such as the velocity
    autocorrelation function. Two new multiple time stepping integrators,
    Langevin Molly (LM) and Brunger-Brooks-Karplus-Molly (BBK-M), are
    introduced in this paper. Both use the mollified impulse method
    for the Newtonian term. LM uses a discretization of the Langevin
    equation that is exact for the constant force, and BBK-M uses the
    popular Brunger-Brooks-Karplus integrator (BBK). These integrators,
    along with an extrapolative method called LN, are evaluated across
    a wide range of damping coefficient values. When large damping coefficients
    are used, as one would for the implicit modeling of solvent molecules,
    the method LN is superior, with LM closely following. However, with
    mild damping of 0.2 ps(-1), LM produces the best results, allowing
    long time steps of 14 fs in simulations containing explicitly modeled
    flexible water. With BBK-M and the same damping coefficient, time
    steps of 12 fs are possible for the same system. Similar results
    are obtained for a solvated protein-DNA simulation of estrogen receptor
    ER with estrogen response element ERE. A parallel version of BBK-M
    runs nearly three times faster than the Verlet-I/r-RESPA (reversible
    reference system propagator algorithm) when using the largest stable
    time step on each one, and it also parallelizes well. The computation
    of diffusion coefficients for flexible water and ER/ERE shows that
    when mild damping of up to 0.2 ps-1 is used the dynamics are not
    significantly distorted. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics programs simulate the behavior of biomolecular
    systems, leading to understanding of their functions. However, the
    computational complexity of such simulations is enormous. Parallel
    machines provide the potential to meet this computational challenge.
    To harness this potential, it is necessary to develop a scalable
    program. It is also necessary that the program be easily modified
    by application-domain programmers. The NAMD2 program presented in
    this paper seeks to provide these desirable features. It uses spatial
    decomposition combined with force decomposition to enhance scalability.
    It uses intelligent periodic load balancing, so as to maximally
    utilize the available compute power. It is modularly organized,
    and implemented using Charm++, a parallel C++ dialect, so as to
    enhance its modifiability. It uses a combination of numerical techniques
    and algorithms to ensure that energy drifts are minimized, ensuring
    accuracy in long running calculations. NAMD2 uses a portable run-time
    framework called Converse that also supports interoperability among
    multiple parallel paradigms. As a result, different components of
    applications can be written in the most appropriate parallel paradigms.
    NAMD2 runs on most parallel machines including workstation clusters

	Abstract = {The purpose of this work is twofold. First, we demonstrate analytically
    that the classical Newmark family as well as related integration
    algorithms are variational in the sense of the Veselov formulation
    of discrete mechanics. Such variational algorithms are well known
    to be symplectic and momentum preserving and to often have excellent
    global energy behaviour. This analytical result is verified through
    numerical examples and is believed to be one of the primary reasons
    that this class of algorithms performs so well. Second, we develop
    algorithms for mechanical systems with forcing, and in particular,
    for dissipative systems. In this case, we develop integrators that
    are based on a discretization of the Lagrange d'Alembert principle
    as well as on a variational formulation of dissipation. It is demonstrated
    that these types of structured integrators have good numerical behaviour

	Abstract = {Rigid-body molecular dynamics simulations typically are performed
    in a quaternion representation. The nonseparable form of the Hamiltonian
    in quaternions prevents the use of a standard leapfrog (Verlet)
    integrator, so nonsymplectic Runge-Kutta, multistep, or extrapolation
    methods are generally used, This is unfortunate since symplectic
    methods like Verlet exhibit superior energy conservation in long-time
    integrations. In this article, we describe an alternative method,
    which we call RSHAKE (for rotation-SHAKE), in which the entire rotation
    matrix is evolved (using the scheme of McLachlan and Scovel [J.
    Nonlin. Sci, 16 233 (1995)]) in tandem with the particle positions.
    We employ a fast approximate Newton solver to preserve the orthogonality

    dipoles and compare with quaternion evolution using a 4th-order
    predictor-corrector integrator, Although the short-time error of
    the quaternion algorithm is smaller for fixed time step than that
    for RSHAKE, the quaternion scheme exhibits an energy drift which

	Abstract = {To obtain insight in the process of water permeation through a lipid
    membrane, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on a phospholipid
    (DPPC)/water system with atomic detail. Since the actual process
    of permeation is too slow to be studied directly, we deduced the
    permeation rate indirectly via computation of the free energy and
    diffusion rate profiles of a water molecule across the bilayer.
    We conclude that the permeation of water through a lipid membrane
    cannot be described adequately by a simple homogeneous solubility-diffusion
    model. Both the excess free energy and the diffusion rate strongly
    depend on the position in the membrane, as a result from the inhomogeneous
    nature of the membrane. The calculated excess free energy profile
    has a shallow slope and a maximum height of 26 kJ/mol. The diffusion
    rate is highest in the middle of the membrane where the lipid density
    is low. In the interfacial region almost all water molecules are
    bound by the lipid headgroups, and the diffusion turns out to be
    1 order of magnitude smaller. The total transport process is essentially
    determined by the free energy barrier. The rate-limiting step is
    the permeation through the dense part of the lipid tails, where
    the resistance is highest. We found a permeation rate of 7(+/-3)
    x 10(-2) cm/s at 350 K, comparable to experimental values for DPPC
    membranes, if corrected for the temperature of the simulation. Taking
    the inhomogeneity of the membrane into account, we define a new
    ''four-region'' model which seems to be more realistic than the
    ''two-phase'' solubility-diffusion model.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a geometric-variational approach to continuous
    and discrete mechanics and field theories. Using multisymplectic
    geometry, we show that the existence of the fundamental geometric
    structures as well as their preservation along solutions can be
    obtained directly from the variational principle. In particular,
    we prove that a unique multisymplectic structure is obtained by
    taking the derivative of an action function, and use this structure
    to prove covariant generalizations of conservation of symplecticity
    and Noether's theorem. Natural discretization schemes for PDEs,
    which have these important preservation properties, then follow
    by choosing a discrete action functional. In the case of mechanics,
    we recover the variational symplectic integrators of Veselov type,
    while for PDEs we obtain covariant spacetime integrators which conserve
    the corresponding discrete multisymplectic form as well as the discrete
    momentum mappings corresponding to symmetries. We show that the
    usual notion of symplecticity along an infinite-dimensional space
    of fields can be naturally obtained by making a spacetime split.
    All of the aspects of our method are demonstrated with a nonlinear

    Its flexibility is achieved primarily through the use of inheritance

    The framework encapsulates important optimizations that can be used

    design is based on domain analysis of numerical integrators for
    molecular dynamics (MD) and of fast solvers for the force computation,
    particularly due to electrostatic interactions. Several new and
    efficient algorithms are implemented in PROTOMOL. Finally, it is
    shown that PROTOMOL'S sequential performance is excellent when compared
    to a leading MD program, and that it scales well for moderate number

    The characteristic molecular structure was considered by joining
    two calamitic Gay-Berne particles through a bond to form a biaxial
    molecule of point symmetry group C-2v with a suitable bending angle.
    The dependence on temperature of systems of N=1024 rigid banana-shaped

    means of Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble

    an untilted smectic phase showing a global phase biaxiality and
    a spontaneous local polarization in the layers, i.e. a local polar

    DNA can potentially induce long-range structural deformations integral
    to mechanisms of biological significance in both prokaryotes and

    for investigating this phenomenon. Duplex DNA is represented as
    a chain of hydrodynamic beads interacting through potentials of
    linearly elastic stretching, bending, and twisting, as well as excluded
    volume. The chain, linear when relaxed, is looped to form two open
    but topologically constrained subdomains. This permits the dynamic
    introduction of torsional stress via a centrally applied torque.
    We simulate by Brownian dynamics the 100 mus response of a 477-base
    pair B-DNA template to the localized torque generated by the prokaryotic
    transcription ensemble. Following a sharp rise at early times, the
    distributed twist assumes a nearly constant value in both subdomains,
    and a succession of supercoiling deformations occurs as superhelical
    stress is increasingly partitioned to writhe. The magnitude of writhe
    surpasses that of twist before also leveling off when the structure
    reaches mechanical equilibrium with the torsional load. Superhelicity
    is simultaneously right handed in one subdomain and left handed
    in the other, as predicted by the #transcription-induced##twin-supercoiled-domain#

	Abstract = {Despite the parsing power of LR/LALR algorithms, e.g. YACC, programmers
    often choose to write recursive-descent parsers by hand to obtain
    increased flexibility, better error handling, and ease of debugging.
    We introduce ANTLR, a public-domain parser generator that combines
    the flexibility of hand-coded parsing with the convenience of a
    parser generator, which is a component of PCCTS. ANTLR has many
    features that make it easier to use than other language tools. Most
    important, ANTLR provides predicates which let the programmer systematically
    direct the parse via arbitrary expressions using semantic and syntactic
    context; in practice, the use of predicates eliminates the need
    to hand-tweak the ANTLR output, even for difficult parsing problems.
    ANTLR also integrates the description of lexical and syntactic analysis,
    accepts LL(k) grammars for k > 1 with extended BNF notation, and
    can automatically generate abstract syntax trees. ANTLR is widely
    used, with over 1000 registered industrial and academic users in
    37 countries. It has been ported to many popular systems such as
    the PC, Macintosh, and a variety of UNIX platforms; a commercial

    sequence and biophysical information about protein-protein complexes,
    the physico-chemical patterns, if any, that make a protein surface
    likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions, remain elusive.
    Here, we apply protein docking simulations and analysis of the interaction
    energy landscapes to identify protein-protein interaction sites.
    The new protocol for global docking based on multi-start global
    energy optimization of an allatom model of the ligand, with detailed
    receptor potentials and atomic solvation parameters optimized in
    a training set of 24 complexes, explores the conformational space
    around the whole receptor without restrictions. The ensembles of
    the rigid-body docking solutions generated by the simulations were
    subsequently used to project the docking energy landscapes onto
    the protein surfaces. We found that highly populated low-energy
    regions consistently corresponded to actual binding sites. The procedure
    was validated on a test set of 21 known protein-protein complexes
    not used in the training set. As much as 81% of the predicted high-propensity
    patch residues were located correctly in the native interfaces.
    This approach can guide the design of mutations on the surfaces

    the long time behavior of numerical integration methods. This is
    true in particular for the integration of Hamiltonian systems where
    backward error analysis can be used to show that a symplectic method
    will conserve energy over exponentially long periods of time. Such
    results are typically based on two aspects of backward error analysis:
    (i) It can be shown that the modified vector fields have some qualitative
    properties which they share with the given problem and (ii) an estimate
    is given for the difference between the best interpolating vector
    field and the numerical method. These aspects have been investigated
    recently, for example, by Benettin and Giorgilli in [J. Statist.
    Phys., 74 (1994), pp. 1117-1143], by Hairer in [Ann. Numer. Math.,

    framework and a simplification of the existing results and corresponding
    proofs. Our approach to backward error analysis is based on a simple
    recursive definition of the modified vector fields that does not
    require explicit Taylor series expansion of the numerical method
    and the corresponding flow maps as in the above-cited works. As

	Abstract = {The mobility of water, Na+. and K+ has been calculated inside a periodic
    poly-(L,D)-alanine beta-helix, a model for the interior of the gramicidin
    channel. Because of the different dynamical regimes for the three
    species (high barrier for Na+, low barrier for K+, almost free diffusion
    for water), different methods are used to calculate the mobilities.
    By use of activated dynamics and a potential of mean force determined
    previously (Roux, B.; Karplus, M. Biophys. J. 1991, 59, 961), the
    barrier crossing rate of Na+ ion is determined. The motion of Na+
    at the transition state is controlled by local interactions and
    collisions with the neighboring carbonyls and the two nearest water
    molecules. There are significant deviations from transition-state
    theory; the transmission coefficient is equal to 0.11. The water
    and K+ motions are found to be well described by a diffusive model;
    the motion of K+ appears to be controlled by the diffusion of water.
    The time-dependent friction functions of Na+ and K+ ions in the
    periodic beta-helix are calculated and analyzed by using a generalized
    Langevin equation approach. Both Na+ and K+ suffer many rapid collisions,
    and their dynamics is overdamped and noninertial. Thus, the selectivity
    sequence of ions in the beta-helix is not influenced strongly by
    their masses.},

    classical molecular dynamics methods, as a very large number (tens

    In this article, we introduce the basic issues for an accurate representation

    no longer necessary to resort to uncontrolled approximations such
    as the use of cutoffs. In particular, we discuss the Ewald summation
    methods, the fast particle mesh methods, and the fast multipole
    methods. We also review recent efforts to understand the role of
    boundary conditions in systems with long-range interactions, and
    conclude with a short perspective on future trends.},

@article{Sandu1999,
	Abstract = {Numerical resonance artifacts have become recognized recently as a
    limiting factor to increasing the timestep in multiple-timestep
    (MTS) biomolecular dynamics simulations. At certain timesteps correlated
    to internal motions (e.g., 5 fs, around half the period of the fastest
    bond stretch, T-min), visible inaccuracies or instabilities can
    occur. Impulse-MTS schemes are vulnerable to these resonance errors
    since large energy pulses are introduced to the governing dynamics
    equations when the slow forces are evaluated. We recently showed
    that such resonance artifacts can be masked significantly by applying
    extrapolative splitting to stochastic dynamics. Theoretical and
    numerical analyses of force-splitting integrators based on the Verlet
    discretization are reported here for linear models to explain these
    observations and to suggest how to construct effective integrators
    for biomolecular dynamics that balance stability with accuracy.
    Analyses for Newtonian dynamics demonstrate the severe resonance
    patterns of the Impulse splitting, with this severity worsening
    with the outer timestep. Delta t: Constant Extrapolation is generally
    unstable, but the disturbances do not grow with Delta t. Thus. the
    stochastic extrapolative combination can counteract generic instabilities
    and largely alleviate resonances with a sufficiently strong Langevin
    heat-bath coupling (gamma), estimates for which are derived here
    based on the fastest and slowest motion periods. These resonance
    results generally hold for nonlinear test systems: a water tetramer
    and solvated protein. Proposed related approaches such as Extrapolation/Correction
    and Midpoint Extrapolation work better than Constant Extrapolation
    only for timesteps less than T-min/2. An effective extrapolative
    stochastic approach for biomolecules that balances long-timestep
    stability with good accuracy for the fast subsystem is then applied
    to a biomolecule using a three-class partitioning: the medium forces
    are treated by Midpoint Extrapolation via position Verlet, and the
    slow forces are incorporated by Constant Extrapolation. The resulting
    algorithm (LN) performs well on a solvated protein system in terms
    of thermodynamic properties and yields an order of magnitude speedup
    with respect to single-timestep Langevin trajectories. Computed
    spectral density functions also show how the Newtonian modes can
    be approximated by using a small gamma in the range Of 5-20 ps(-1).

    Oxford, 1986)] and Kuzuu [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 52, 3486 (1983)]. Here
    this theory is put to the test by comparing it against computer
    simulations. A Brownian dynamics simulation program was developed
    to follow the dynamics of the rods, with a length over a diameter
    ratio of 60, on the Smoluchowski time scale. The model accounts
    for excluded volume interactions between rods, but neglects hydrodynamic
    interactions. The self-rotational diffusion coefficients D-r(phi)
    of the rods were calculated by standard methods and by a new, more
    efficient method based on calculating average restoring torques.
    Collective decay of orientational order was calculated by means
    of equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations. Our results show
    that, for the currently accessible volume fractions, the decay times
    in both cases are virtually identical. Moreover, the observed decay
    of diffusion coefficients with volume fraction is much quicker than

	Abstract = {We have implemented a portable parallel version of the macromolecular
    modeling package AMBER4. The message passing paradigm was used.
    All message passing constructs are compliant with the Message Passing
    Interface (MPI) standard. The molecular dynamics/minimization module
    MINMD and the free-energy perturbation module Gibbs have been implemented
    in parallel on a number of machines, including a Gray T3D, an IBM
    SP1/SP2, and a collection of networked workstations. In addition,
    the code has been tested with an MPI implementation from Argonne
    National Laboratories/Mississippi State University which runs on
    many parallel machines. The goal of this work is to decrease the
    amount of time required to perform molecular dynamics simulations.
    Performance results for a Lipid bilayer molecular dynamics simulation
    on a Gray T3D, an IBM SP1/SPZ and a Gray C90 are compared. (C) 1995

	Abstract = {The effects of longitudinal quadrupole moments on the formation of
    liquid crystalline phases are studied by means of constant NPT Monte
    Carlo simulation methods. The popular Gay-Berne model mesogen is
    used as the reference fluid, which displays the phase sequences
    isotropic-smectic A-smectic B and isotropic-smectic B at high (T*=2.0)
    and low (T*=1.5) temperatures, respectively. With increasing quadrupole
    magnitude the smectic phases are observed to be stabilized with
    respect to the isotropic liquid, while the smectic B is destabilized
    with respect to the smectic A. At the lower temperature, a sufficiently
    large quadrupole magnitude results in the injection of the smectic
    A phase into the phase sequence and the replacement of the smectic
    B phase by the tilted smectic J phase. The nematic phase is also
    injected into the phase sequence at both temperatures considered,
    and ultimately for sufficiently large quadrupole magnitudes no coherent
    layered structures were observed. The stabilization of the smectic
    A phase supports the commonly held belief that, while the inclusion
    of polar groups is not a prerequisite for the formation of the smectic
    A phase, quadrupolar interactions help to increase the temperature
    and pressure range for which the smectic A phase is observed. The
    quality of the layered structure is worsened with increasing quadrupole
    magnitude. This behavior, along with the injection of the nematic
    phase into the phase sequence, indicate that the general tendency
    of the quadrupolar interactions is to destabilize the layered structure.
    A pressure dependence upon the smectic layer spacing is observed.
    This behavior is in much closer agreement with experimental findings
    than has been observed previously for nonpolar Gay-Berne and hard
    spherocylinder models. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {It has been demonstrated that a "near-Levinthal" cooperative mechanism, whereby the common G[o] interaction scheme is augmented by an extra favorability for the native state as a whole, can lead to apparent two-state folding/unfolding kinetics over a broad range of native stabilities in lattice models of proteins. Here such a mechanism is shown to be generalizable to a simplified continuum (off-lattice) Langevin dynamics model with a C{alpha} protein chain representation, with the resulting chevron plots exhibiting an extended quasilinear regime reminiscent of that of apparent two-state real proteins. Similarly high degrees of cooperativity are possible in G[o]-like continuum models with rudimentary pairwise desolvation barriers as well. In these models, cooperativity increases with increasing desolvation barrier height, suggesting strongly that two-state-like folding/unfolding kinetics would be achievable when the pairwise desolvation barrier becomes sufficiently high. Besides cooperativity, another generic folding property of interest that has emerged from published experiments on several apparent two-state proteins is that their folding relaxation under constant native stability (isostability) conditions is essentially Arrhenius, entailing high intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers of [~]17-30 kcal/mol. Based on a new analysis of published data on barnase, here we propose that a similar property should also apply to a certain class of non-two-state proteins that fold with chevron rollovers. However, several continuum G[o]-like constructs considered here fail to predict any significant intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier under isostability conditions; thus the physical origin of such barriers in real proteins remains to be elucidated.

	Abstract = {The solution properties, including hydrodynamic quantities and the radius of gyration, of globular proteins are calculated from their detailed, atomic-level structure, using bead-modeling methodologies described in our previous article (Carrasco and Garcia de la Torre, 1999, Biophys. J. 76:3044-3057). We review how this goal has been pursued by other authors in the past. Our procedure starts from a list of atomic coordinates, from which we build a primary hydrodynamic model by replacing nonhydrogen atoms with spherical elements of some fixed radius. The resulting particle, consisting of overlapping spheres, is in turn represented by a shell model treated as described in our previous work. We have applied this procedure to a set of 13 proteins. For each protein, the atomic element radius is adjusted, to fit all of the hydrodynamic properties, taking values close to 3 A, with deviations that fall within the error of experimental data. Some differences are found in the atomic element radius found for each protein, which can be explained in terms of protein hydration. A computational shortcut makes the procedure feasible, even in personal computers. All of the model-building and calculations are carried out with a HYDROPRO public-domain computer program.

	Abstract = {A compilation and an implementation of different methodologies to simulate NPT ensembles on finite systems is presented. In general, the methods discussed can be classified in two different groups depending on how the external pressure is applied to the system. The first approach is based on including the pressure with its conjugate thermodynamical variable, the volume, in the Lagrangian of the system. For this group four different volume definitions were considered and we assess their validity by studying the structural properties of small systems as function of pressure. In particular, we focus on the stability of the C-60 molecule as well as the amorphization process of a diamond-like cluster under pressure. In the second group, the finite system (C-60) is embedded in a classical fluid which serves as a pressure reservoir. We take the latter method as reference because it is closest to the experimental situation. The difficulties and the regimes where these methods can be used are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = { The calculation of hydrodynamic and other solution properties of rigid macromolecules, using bead-shell model methodologies, requires the specification of the macromolecular shape in a format that can be interfaced with existing programs for hydrodynamic computations. Here, a procedure is presented for such a structural specification that is applicable to arbitrarily shaped particles. A computer program (), in which the user inserts the code needed to determine the structure, produces an structural file that is interpreted by another program () which is in charge of the computation of properties. As simple and yet illustrative examples we consider two cases: (1) dimeric structures composed of ellipsoidal subunits; and (2) toroidal structures, presenting simple equations that predict the properties of toroids with varying radial ratios.},
