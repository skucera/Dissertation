\begin{abstract}
In this dissertation I present work on elucidating factors important to heat transport in gold nanostructures, particularly nanoparticles, examining the effect of particle size, ligand layer rigidity, and surface gold vibrational freedom. The interfacial thermal conductance of various particles, as well as the thermal conductivity of nanoarrays that are of interest to see trends in heat transport.
Direct simulations of interfacial thermal conductance of solvated gold nanoparticles using molecular dynamics were calculated. All particle simulations used the Langevin Hull method for non-periodic systems.

Experimental nanoparticles contain a moiety, or ligand layer, at the surface of each particle that prevents aggregation and is a result of the method used in the formation of the particles. This moiety is essential in controlling movement of heat from a particle to the surrounding media. In particular, the following study looks closely at how the rigidity of this ligand layer and the length of the ligand change thermal transport at the interface of the particle. This allows for further insight into the important factors for ligand and solvent interactions to optimize heat flow. Proposed mechanisms for heat transfer rely on two effects: the vibrational overlap of the materials at the interface and the density overlap of the same materials.

After finding no direct relationship for particle size with the ligand layer and the thermal transport, a simpler system was examined: bare nanoparticles in solvent.
The particles consist of nanospheres, icosahedra, and cuboctahedra. The latter two display facets that are common in many nanostructures due to their stability.
The interfacial thermal conductivity (G) of the particles was examined based on radius and particle type. The coordination of gold atoms at the particle surface, giving information about the vibrational freedom, displayed a slight correlation with G. This supports the proposed important factors for heat transport found in the ligand layer work.

Finally, the ideas from both prior works are combined to study $Au_{144}PET_{60}$ particles in isolation and in an array. These small particles ($r \approx 10$ \AA) have highly undercoordinated gold atoms within the ligand layer. The thermal conductivity of the composite material is predicted using the Hasselman and Johnson equation using components of the material and compared to preliminary results for the simulated nanoarrays. In the predicted conductivity, the nanoarray thermal conductivity is highly dependent on the geometric feature, $v_p$, the particle volume fraction.
